"""Render docs/guides/measuring_ground_truth.md as an illustrated PDF handbook.

The diagrams are drawn here rather than photographed, so they stay correct if
the procedure changes.

The one photograph-like figure comes from a rendered run under
compare_old_vs_new/, which is generated output and not kept in the repository.
When it is absent the page still builds, without that figure; to restore it,
re-run the comparison and its renderer. The committed PDF was built while it
existed, so the figure is in there.

That figure is the cut solid from a real reconstruction
from inputs/1_left -- the segment its own cut produced, whose two ends ARE the
bands -- annotated with the heights the tape method would use.
