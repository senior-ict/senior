# Progress log — findings, derivations and measurements

Everything this project has established, in the order it was established, with
the reasoning and the arithmetic kept rather than summarised. It began as a
change log against `senior-ict/senior` `main` and grew into the working record:
what was tried, what it measured, what the measurement meant, and which claims
were later withdrawn.

**What this file is for.** It is the source to write a proposal or a report from.
[`updates.md`](updates.md) is the polished "what is better and how do you know";
[`experiments.md`](experiments.md) is the indexed experiment register. This one
keeps the derivations, the dead ends and the corrections, because those are the
parts that are hard to reconstruct later and the parts a reviewer asks about.

> **Claims withdrawn during this work are marked in place rather than deleted.**
> Three numbers that were quoted here turned out not to reproduce, and knowing
> which they were is more useful than a file that looks clean.

Reference point: `origin/main` at `bab2bbc`. This tree is `keng-branch` at `38d0392`
plus uncommitted work. Two layers, described separately because they were done at
different times and carry different confidence:

- **Layer 1** — three commits already on `keng-branch`. +3440 / −1076 across 26 files.
- **Layer 2** — uncommitted work from the current session. +666 / −65 across 9 files,
  plus three new modules and one new pipeline stage.

Every number quoted below was measured on `inputs/small_leg` or `inputs/est_325`
unless stated otherwise. Where a change was made and later found to be wrong, that
is recorded too — the reasoning matters more than the diff.

# Layer 1 — committed

## 1.1 `pipeline/stages/volume.py` — how the scale is derived  ⟨PARKED⟩

**Functions touched:** `compute_volumes`, `_load_mesh_info`, `_measure_volume`

### Before

```python
real_ref_vol = REFERENCE_REAL_SIZE_CM ** 3      # 14³ = 2744 cm³
k            = real_ref_vol / ref["volume"]     # cm³ per mesh-unit³
linear_scale = k ** (1.0 / 3.0)
```

Scale came from the **ratio of volumes**: the reference cube's real volume divided
by its reconstructed mesh volume.

### Why that was wrong

It forces the reference's own error to zero. If the cube reconstructs 5% small,
`k` absorbs exactly that 5%, the cube reports 2744 cm³ on the nose, and the error is
silently transferred onto the limb instead. The pipeline could not report how well
it had reconstructed its own reference, because the answer was always "perfectly".

Worse, the correction it applies is **isotropic** — a single cube-root spread over
all three axes — while the actual error is not. The cube's vertical axis
reconstructs short and its horizontals do not, so a uniform correction is the wrong
shape of fix.

### After

```python
linear_scale = REFERENCE_REAL_SIZE_CM / ref_edge   # cm per unit, from fitted faces
k            = linear_scale ** 3
```

Scale comes from a **length**: the mean of the cube's two horizontal fitted-face
separations. The vertical is deliberately excluded, because it is the axis that
reconstructs short.

### What improved

The reference's residual is now a real, reportable measurement rather than a
definition. It reads −1.86% on the six-frame baseline and −1.54% in the current
configuration. That number is the pipeline's own honesty check, and it did not
exist before.

`compute_volumes` also gained a voxel-occupancy cross-check per mesh (an
independent volume estimate that should sit 1–8% above the exact signed volume),
and a squareness self-check that reports the cube's three edges as shares of their
sum — 33.33% each if perfectly cubic, and scale-free, so it needs no ground truth.

---

## 1.2 `pipeline/core/faces.py` — new file, 158 lines  ⟨PARKED — nothing imports it now⟩

**Functions:** `fit_box_faces`, `reference_edges`, `_triangle_normals_and_areas`

### The problem

The reference edge used to come from an oriented bounding box. An OBB must
*contain* the convex hull of the points it wraps, so any excess is pure fitting
error — and on `inputs/est_325` the OBB exceeded its own hull by 6.8% in volume,
consistent with the box being mis-rotated by roughly 1.3°.

```
face-to-face box       2505.7 cm³     the cube's real size
convex hull of points  2479.2 cm³     −1.1%
oriented bounding box  2647.8 cm³     +5.7%
```

### The fix

A cube does not need a bounding box to be measured. Its face normals *are* its
axes. `fit_box_faces` clusters triangle normals by direction (area-weighted, so
that numerous tiny corner triangles cannot outvote a real face), fits a plane to
each face, and pairs opposite faces.

Separation is measured **through the mesh centroid** rather than by differencing
plane offsets, because opposite faces splay by about 1° and differencing would
measure the gap extrapolated away from the object.

### What improved

Reference volume error **−10.7% → −4.7%** on that dataset. This module is for
box-shaped references only; it is never applied to a limb.

---

## 1.3 `pipeline/stages/clean.py` — floor removal and the cut rule

**Functions touched:** `clean_and_extract`, `clean_and_extract_objects`,
`_segment_leg`, `_count_markers_on_ply`. The file is the largest single change in
Layer 1 (+713 lines changed).

### Floor removal

VGGT reconstructs a flat floor as a **duplicated pair of sheets** — the same
ghosting it produces on the limb. The floor is therefore about two RANSAC
thresholds thick, and removing only the plane's inliers took the middle and left
both skins behind:

```
distance from fitted plane, points surviving a 1x removal
  [-0.010,-0.005)  20,080
  [-0.005,+0.005)     614      <- the band that was actually removed
  [+0.005,+0.010)  21,669
```

Those 41,749 leftover points are a full-size slab of floor. DBSCAN then linked the
limb, the cube and that slab into one cluster, and Stage 3 exported the entire
scene as the limb while labelling a 3,743-point sliver as the object.

`PLANE_REMOVAL_BAND_MULT = 2.0` removes a band two thresholds wide. At 2× the floor
stops reappearing — the next dominant plane is a wall, dot 0.19 with the floor
instead of 1.00 — and the box cluster becomes cube-shaped (cubeness 0.87). Past 2×
the gain flattens while the removal starts eating whatever rests on the floor.

### Marker detection and the cut

The old rule is described in 1.4. Its practical effect here was that the cut plane
was fitted to a shadow, and the pipeline measured a slab of ankle.

---

## 1.4 `pipeline/core/segmentation.py` — marker detection

**Functions touched:** `detect_markers`, `cluster_markers`, `compute_cluster_planes`,
`cut_surface_plane`, `segment_point_cloud`, `rgb_to_hsv`

### Before

```python
hsv_mask = (s > 15) & (h > 60)
exg_mask = (2 * g - r - b) > 10
```

Hardcoded, unparameterised. `hue > 60` accepts hue 60–360 — everything except red,
orange and yellow — with **no brightness floor at all**.

### Why that failed

On `inputs/small_leg` it classified two things as markers:

```
shadow  RGB(8,6,8)      V=3.1%    hue is arbitrary at that brightness
skin    RGB(139,87,89)  hue=358°  which `hue > 60` happily admits
```

The shadow cluster had **3349 supporting points against 197 for the real band**, so
it won the cut.

### After

Thresholds moved to `pipeline/config.py` and made overridable per call:

```python
MARKER_HUE_MIN = 70.0     # degrees; below this is yellow/orange/red
MARKER_HUE_MAX = 180.0    # above this is cyan/blue/magenta
MARKER_SAT_MIN = 25.0     # percent
MARKER_VAL_MIN = 15.0     # percent; below this hue is numerically unstable
MARKER_EXG_MIN = 10       # 2G-R-B
```

`MARKER_VAL_MIN` is the important one: hue is numerically unstable as value
approaches zero, so any dark pixel can land anywhere on the wheel.

A detail worth recording, because it explains the design: the `small_leg` band is
**khaki**, RGB(60,52,30), hue 44° — it fails every green hue test. What finds it is
excess green, +14 against skin at −54. The hue window's job is to *exclude* skin,
not to describe the band. Raising `MARKER_EXG_MIN` to 15 silently lost the only real
marker in the dataset.

`MARKER_MIN_CLUSTER_PTS = 40` replaced a hardcoded 150. A real band is small — 99
points out of 182k on `small_leg`, because only the part facing a camera
reconstructs — and 150 rejected it. The old loose colour rule only cleared 150 by
padding clusters with shadow, which is what produced the 3349-point "marker".

---

## 1.5 `workers/recons_methods_worker.py` — alpha shape selection

**Functions touched:** `method_alpha_shape`, `method_poisson`, `method_ball_pivot`,
`_load_and_prep`, `_post_process`

### Before

A list of absolute alpha values, taking the first that produced *any* mesh. No
topology test — a mesh with tunnels or disconnected blobs was accepted as long as
it was produced.

### After

Alpha is searched as **multiples of mean nearest-neighbour spacing**, so it adapts
to point density instead of assuming a scene scale, and the accepted mesh must be
watertight **and** Euler number 2 — a simple closed surface. A mesh that is closed
but has genus (tunnels) has an invalid volume and is now rejected as such.

`workers/recons_worker.py` (164 lines) was deleted; `recons_methods_worker.py`
supersedes it.

---

## 1.6 Other new modules in Layer 1

| file | purpose |
|---|---|
| ~~`pipeline/detection.py` (200)~~ | object detection seeds — **deleted 2026-08-22**; the code that called it discarded both of its return values, so the flag cost two model loads and changed nothing. The models it wrapped now live in `pipeline/core/vlm_detect.py`, used by Stage 0. |
| `pipeline/ghost.py` (99) | ghost-sheet dedup — VGGT's duplicated surfaces |
| ~~`pipeline/mls.py`~~ (109) | moving-least-squares surface projection — **merged into `pipeline/ghost.py` on 2026-08-23** and deleted; the three ghost steps are only legible together. Verified behaviour-neutral (bit-identical `volumes.csv`) |
| `pipeline/multiview.py` (94) | multi-view consistency filter |
| `stagerun.py` (593) | per-stage runner, so a stage can be re-run without redoing inference |

`MULTIVIEW_MIN_VIEWS` is set to 0 — disabled, and the reason is recorded in
`config.py`. It was built to remove ghost sheets and does not work: shell thickness
was unchanged at every setting while up to 41% of the cloud was discarded. The
ghost is the same model making the same mistake in every view, so the views agree
with each other and the ghost passes. It is kept as a genuine geometric
self-consistency diagnostic, just not as a ghost filter.

---

# Layer 2 — this session, uncommitted

## 2.1 `pipeline/stages/prep.py` — Stage 0, new stage

**Functions:** `prepare_frames`, `_cube_faces`, `_cube_bbox`, `_face_corners`,
`_leg_mask`, `_band_bbox`, `_square_window`, `_vggt_window`, `_grow`,
`_debug_overlay`

### The problem it exists for

VGGT is handed a 518×518 square. Its default `crop` mode resizes the width to 518
and centre-crops the height, which on a 9:16 phone photo **discards 43.8% of every
frame**:

```
2160x3840 -> width 518, height 924 -> centre-crop to 518
keeps original rows 844..2996
```

That is not a neutral loss. It clipped the reference cube's base on two of six
frames — IMG_4458 by 457 px and IMG_4462 by 182 px — and the cube is the object
that sets the scale for every number the pipeline reports. Nothing downstream can
detect or undo it.

### Locating the cube — `_face_corners`, `_cube_bbox`

The markers are not the cube. A 6.3 cm black square sits inside a 14 cm face, so
sizing a window on marker corners **understates the cube by 120–300 px per side**.

Scaling the marker box outward would be wrong, because perspective does not
preserve distance ratios. But the marker's own four corners are four known points
on the face plane, so they *define* the homography between that plane and the
image:

```python
src = [(-3.15,-3.15), (3.15,-3.15), (3.15,3.15), (-3.15,3.15)]   # marker, cm
H    = getPerspectiveTransform(src, detected_corners)
dst  = [(-7,-7), (7,-7), (7,7), (-7,7)]                          # face, cm
face_corners = perspectiveTransform(dst, H)
```

The face's corners have known coordinates in that plane, so mapping them through
`H` is **exact**, not approximate.

One face still bounds only itself — the cube continues behind it, and a single face
understates by up to 203 px. Two adjacent faces cover most of the silhouette, which
is why two were briefly required. That was dropped: the requirement was never "two
faces", it was "a box containing the cube". The cube box is now the **union of the
marker face quads and an open-vocabulary detection of the box**. Each under-covers
alone — the detector by 22–90 px on every frame — but they under-cover in different
directions, so the union does not.

`solvePnP` from a single marker was tried and rejected: a planar square has a
two-fold pose ambiguity that bites hardest when the face is seen edge-on, which is
exactly the case where only one marker is visible. On IMG_4463 it returned a 1378 px
cube from a 207 px face.

### The window — `_square_window`

Full frame width, square, slid vertically until the cube and the band both fit.

Nothing is lost horizontally. Vertically the loss is unavoidable — the square is as
tall as the frame is wide, which is the largest square that exists in a portrait
frame — but its *position* is chosen rather than fixed at centre. Measured offsets
from where VGGT would have cropped:

```
IMG_4459  +133 px      IMG_4462  +434 px     <- its cube was being cut by 178 px
IMG_4460   −81 px      IMG_4463  −300 px
IMG_4461   −47 px      IMG_4458   cannot fit at any offset
```

Sliding vertically also costs less than a freely-placed window. VGGT's pose
encoding is 9 values — 3 translation, 4 quaternion, 2 field-of-view — and carries
**no principal point**; it emits `cx = cy = image centre` on every frame. A
full-width window keeps the horizontal principal point exactly right and misstates
only the vertical, where a subject-centred square got both wrong.

### The gate

Every submitted frame must pass, and at least `MIN_FRAMES = 6` must pass, or the
pipeline does not start. Failures are reported by position in the submitted order
(`img1 (IMG_4458.jpg)`).

Each failure carries a reason and a severity, from `_reject_reasons()`. The two
questions are kept apart because a person acts on them differently: was the object
**seen**, and did it **survive the window**.

| condition | reason | severity | rejected? |
|---|---|---|---|
| band missing, cube seen | `marker missing, not crucial` | not crucial | no |
| cube missing, band seen | `cube missing, crucial` | crucial | yes |
| both missing | `marker and cube missing, very crucial` | very crucial | yes |
| detected, does not fit | `objects out of window` | crucial / very crucial | yes |

A missing band costs the cut but not the scale, and the cut only needs the band on
some frames, so that frame is reported and kept. A missing or clipped cube costs the
scale of every number the run reports, silently, which is why this stage refuses
rather than warns.

The out-of-window reason deliberately does **not** name which object was clipped.
The window is not something a person can adjust — it is the largest square the photo
allows, placed by this stage — so the remedy is identical either way: step back and
re-take. `cube_ok` / `band_ok` remain in `manifest.json` for debugging, and severity
still tracks the consequence even though the message does not.

**Anything not croppable goes to VGGT untouched**, including rejected frames, which
are now written rather than skipped so they can be inspected. If the window could
not hold the cube and the band, any crop it emitted would cut something that
matters, so VGGT applies its own preprocessing instead. A viewpoint reconstructed
from a worse crop is still a viewpoint; a deleted one is not.
`--continue-on-rejected` controls whether the run proceeds, not whether the frames
exist.

Two bugs fixed here. `"band not found"` was unreachable — `band_ok` is `True`
whenever the band is `None`, so a missing band could never produce it. And
`stagerun.py` re-derived its own copy of the reasons, which had drifted: its summary
still said `"cube not contained"` after the stage had begun distinguishing a cube
that was never seen from one the window cuts. Both now read one helper.

### Output

518×518 directly, `INTER_AREA`. For a square input VGGT's own arithmetic is
`round(518/14)*14 = 518` exactly, so its centre-crop branch never fires and nothing
is discarded twice. Doing the reduction here also means the filter is ours, and it
structurally removes a 0.34% vertical stretch that the 921→924 patch-size rounding
introduces on non-square input.

`for_debug/` carries an annotated copy of every frame — crop window in yellow, cube
in magenta, band in green, with the verdict and reason — including rejected ones,
which is precisely where they are needed.

---

## 2.2 `pipeline/core/vlm_detect.py` — new file

**Functions:** `detect`, `segment`, `trace_band_colour`, `_models`, `release`

Open-vocabulary detection (GroundingDINO `IDEA-Research/grounding-dino-tiny`) and
box-prompted segmentation (`facebook/sam-vit-base`).

### Why a model here and not for the cube

The cube carries printed markers, so its silhouette is recoverable exactly by
geometry — no model involved, and a detector would be strictly worse (it falls
inside the true silhouette on every frame).

The limb and the band were class-based and colour-based rules, and both were
brittle for the same reason: they encoded one particular capture.

- The limb came from a COCO `person` mask, which contains the whole body. Its union
  with the cube demanded a square **98–161% of the frame** — larger than the frame
  itself. A box cannot separate a limb from the body it belongs to.
- The band came from `2G − R − B > 10`, tuned to one khaki band, which fired on a
  **houseplant** instead of the band on two frames.

Naming them instead removes both limitations. Measured: the band is found on **6 of
6 frames at 0.81–0.84 confidence**, including the two where the colour rule failed
outright.

### `trace_band_colour` — reading the colour off the band

This took three attempts and the failures are instructive.

The band is a **thin diagonal cord occupying 3–5% of its own bounding box**. So:

1. A median over the box returns skin. It confidently reported the *limb's* colour.
2. Taking the pixels least like skin returns **shadow** — they came out at excess
   green −14 where the band is known to be +14.
3. What is true of the cord is that it **crosses every column of the box exactly
   once**. Scanning column by column and taking the pixel that departs furthest
   from that column's own median traces the cord itself.

Result: RGB(37,30,9), excess green **+14** — exactly the value `MARKER_EXG_MIN` was
hand-tuned to, but derived from the image.

The same trace records the **limb's** colour from the surrounding columns, which
turns out to matter more than the band's (see 2.3).

---

## 2.3 `pipeline/core/segmentation.py` — marker detection by learned contrast

**New function:** `marker_mask_by_contrast`. **Modified:** `segment_point_cloud`
(now takes `marker_colour`).

### The wrong version, recorded because it failed loudly

The first attempt derived a hue/saturation/value window centred on the measured
band colour. It was catastrophic:

```
config window (hand-tuned)      hue  70-180   sat>25   val>15   ExG>10
derived colour window           hue   15-75   sat>34   val>5.1  ExG>7.0
marker cluster selected         102,988 points        (a real band is ~210)
```

Two errors. `val > 5.1%` ignored the config's own warning that 15% is the floor
that matters. And centring the hue window **on** the band put it at 15–75° while
skin sits at 11–20° — so the window admitted the entire limb.

The lesson: the hand-tuned window works because it **excludes skin**, not because
it describes the band. Learning the band's colour and centring a window on it
throws that away.

### The right version

The discriminator is the **contrast between band and limb**, both of which Stage 0
now measures. They are two points in colour space; the line between them is the
direction along which they differ, and everything else is irrelevant:

```python
score = ((chroma(pixel) - chroma(limb)) @ axis) / (axis @ axis)   # axis = band - limb
mask  = score > 0.5        # closer to the band than to the limb
```

Working in **chromaticity** (brightness divided out) rather than raw RGB matters:
this band is darker as well as differently coloured, so the raw axis points partly
along brightness and shadowed skin scores as band — 3,244 points selected. Dividing
intensity out keeps only the chromatic difference, which is exactly why the
hand-tuned rule leaned on excess green rather than value.

The threshold is 0.5 because that is the decision boundary the projection already
defines, not a number tuned until this dataset gave a pleasing count.

### What improved

```
                                   points selected
config window (hand-tuned)              13
derived colour window (the bug)     17,726
chromaticity contrast @ 0.5             12
```

Back in line with the hand-tuned rule, from colours the pipeline measured.

And it generalises, which was the point. On synthetic red and blue bands:

```
                learned            derived thresholds       old rule
khaki (real)    RGB(37,30,9)  +14   hue  14-74, ExG 7        works
red             RGB(203,40,42) −165  hue 329-360, ExG off     FAILS (needs ExG > +10)
blue            RGB(41,60,203) −124  hue 203-263, ExG off     FAILS
```

Excess green is kept only when the marker is actually green-dominant; otherwise it
is meaningless and hue carries the detection.

## 2.4 `pipeline/core/markers3d.py` — new file, an independent scale check  ⟨PARKED — nothing imports it now⟩

**Functions:** `detect_marker_quads`, `quad_metrics`, `edge_lengths_by_axis`,
`infer_up_axis`

The reference cube is the pipeline's only ruler, so it cannot check itself: scale
comes from its own fitted faces, so it measures 14.00 cm whatever it really is. The
squareness check has the same blind spot — inflate all three edges equally and the
shares do not move.

The printed markers are a second structure the calibration never touches. ArUco
locates their corners sub-pixel, and those corner pixels index
`predictions.npz["world_points"]` directly, so a marker lifts into 3D with no colour
thresholding, no meshing and no image-to-cloud mapping.

Most of the value needs **no physical constant at all**. A printed marker is flat
and square, so departures are pure reconstruction error:

```
flatness      0.04-0.45 mm    the surface is locally accurate
aspect        1.077-1.079     a square reconstructs ~8% out of square
size spread   3.7-3.9%        one physical square, measured on five faces
```

Reproducibility is what makes it usable: **0.4518 and 0.4507** on two independent
captures with different scenes and scale factors — agreement to 0.24%.

`REFERENCE_MARKER_CM` is deliberately left unset. The sheet was designed at 7.00 cm
but did not print at that size — rectifying the photographs through the marker's own
homography and holding the box at its measured 14.00 cm puts the printed square at
**6.49–6.58 cm**, about 93% of design and consistent with "fit to page" scaling.
Setting 7.00 would bake in a false 10% discrepancy.

---

## 2.5 `workers/recons_methods_worker.py` — two fixes

### The alpha ladder was one rung too short

```python
ALPHA_MULTIPLIERS = [..., 70.0, 90.0]                       # before
ALPHA_MULTIPLIERS = [..., 90.0, 115.0, 140.0, 170.0, 200.0] # after
```

A limb cloud that closes cleanly at 140× reported "no watertight alpha found" and
fell through to a repair path. It was not under-sampled or holed — its Euler number
fell monotonically 2202, 868, 654, 398, 222, 102, 16, 2 with **no boundary edges at
any step**, which is a surface converging, not failing.

Order still matters more than the ceiling: since the smallest sound alpha wins,
adding coarse rungs cannot make a cloud that already closes finely choose a coarse
one.

### The fallback was pinned to the worst candidate

```python
if fallback is None or (wt and not isinstance(fallback[0], type(None))):
    if fallback is None:          # <- inner guard: never updates after the first
        fallback = (m, mul)
```

The outer condition could never do anything either — `fallback[0]` is a mesh, so
`isinstance(..., type(None))` is always False. So the fallback was fixed on the
**first** iteration, and the search starts at the smallest alpha, which is the most
shredded candidate of all. A run that failed to close reported the worst mesh it had
built rather than the best. Measured effect when it fired: limb volume 399.13 cm³
with Euler 430, against a 1074 cm³ expectation.

Now ranked: closed beats open; among those, Euler nearest 2; ties to the mesh with
more surface. Same failing run then produced 850.42 cm³.

# Layer 3 — after this document was first written

Four things, in descending order of how much they change the numbers.

## 3.1 `pipeline/core/vlm_detect.py` — the band colour was measured off the wrong pixels

The cut was landing visibly tilted. Root cause was not the plane fit: it was that
`trace_band_colour` reported a colour the reconstruction never contains.

The trace locates the cord by taking, for each column of the band box, the pixel
departing furthest from that column's median. That pixel is the cord's *most
extreme* one — its darkest, most shadowed core. But a 3D point takes the colour of
whatever cord pixel its ray happened to land on, which is a typical one:

| | band RGB | chromatic B |
|---|---|---|
| reported by the trace | (37.5, 30.0, 9.0) | 0.118 |
| what the point cloud actually holds | (69.7, 61.6, 35.7) | 0.214 |

Stage 3's contrast axis was therefore calibrated on one colour and applied to
another. True band points scored a median of **0.298** along an axis thresholded at
**0.50**, so 85% of the band was discarded — 193 points became 40 — and the
surviving sliver measured 0.21 × 0.04 × 0.03 cm. A strip that thin does not
determine a plane normal (its second and third singular values are within 20% of
each other), so SVD returned an essentially arbitrary one.

The fix is one parameter: `dilate=3`, sampling three rows either side of the traced
cord so the colour describes the cord's body.

> [`experiments/cut_plane_band_colour.png`](experiments/cut_plane_band_colour.png).

| | marker points | plane tilt | off perpendicular to the limb |
|---|---|---|---|
| before | 40 | 30.5° | **20.8°** |
| main's hardcoded detector, for reference | 193 | 19.7° | 3.2° |
| after | **302** | **18.4°** | **1.3°** |

Corroboration, three independent ways: the limb's own axis fitted at that height is
18.0°; main's colour-window detector puts the plane at 19.7°; and the volume it
produces agrees with main's detector to **0.33%** (1071.46 against 1075.04 cm³).
The value of the fix is that it keeps the colour *learned*, so a marker of any
colour works, while matching a detector that only worked because its hue window
happened to exclude this particular skin.

Three alternatives were tested and rejected, recorded because each looked plausible:

- **Tuning the threshold.** Not an operating point: 0.40 → 1.3°, 0.35 → 20.4°,
  0.30 → 82°. True band median is 0.298 and limb p99 is 0.300, so the two
  populations overlap and no threshold separates them.
- **SAM on the band box.** Box-prompted SAM returns the dominant object in the box,
  and inside a band box that is the *limb*. Its mask covers ~13% of the box where
  the cord is ~1.5%, giving ExG +5.0 against the cord's +13.5. Result: 816 "band"
  points and **8.6°** off perpendicular — worse than the trace. SAM stays for the
  leg and cube masks, which are objects; a 2–3 px cord is not.
- **Measuring at VGGT's own 518 resolution**, on the theory that it would match the
  cloud better. It does not: 1.8° at `dilate=0` and **87.6°** at `dilate=1`, which
  swallows the whole limb (14,162 points). At 518 the cord is 2–3 px and every
  pixel is already blended with skin, so there is no clean population left to
  sample. At full resolution it is 10–15 px wide, which is what makes dilation work.

Also confirmed while chasing this: point colours are **not** averaged across views.
`pipeline/stages/pointcloud.py:61` assigns each point the colour of its own pixel
in its own view.

## 3.2 The cut is deferred until a person confirms it

Stage 3 always had `apply_cut=False`, which stops after the uncut cloud and
publishes the detected planes. Nothing used it. Now the measuring pass does.

`stagerun.py --no-cut` runs Stage 3 in that mode: it detects the cutting planes and
publishes them, and deliberately **does not write `leg_cut.ply`**, so Stages 4–6
measure only the reference cube. The limb is not reconstructed at all until the cut
is agreed. Cutting on the first pass instead would put a volume on screen derived
from a cut nobody had approved, and then ask the user to confirm it — the
confirmation would be theatre.

`stagerun.py --cut-only` is the second half. It reads back `leg_open.ply` — the
levelled, filtered, floor-cut limb saved in exactly the state the cut operates on —
applies the confirmed planes, caps the cross-section, and closes to the floor. SOR,
RANSAC, DBSCAN, ghost filtering, MLS and levelling are not repeated.

Two details this depends on, both of which were bugs first:

- **`leg_open.ply` had to be added.** The full path cuts the *pre-floor-close* cloud
  and closes whatever the cut leaves open. `leg_no_cut.ply` is the post-close cloud
  and carries a fabricated floor skirt, so cutting *it* would silently produce
  different numbers. `floor_z` is now persisted in `levelling.json` for the same
  reason.
- **Stage 4 and 5 left stale meshes behind.** When Stage 3 stopped writing
  `leg_cut.ply`, the previous run's `leg_cut_recon.ply` survived and Stage 5 globbed
  it — so a deferred cut still reported a cut limb. Stage 4 now prunes meshes with
  no object behind them, and reuses a mesh newer than its source cloud, so the
  reference cube is reconstructed once rather than twice.

Correctness check: applying the *detected* plane through the split path reproduces
the un-split run at `1126.1505024938106 cm³` — identical to the last digit. The
split changed when the cut happens, not what it computes.

Cost, measured: the confirm pass went from 23.5 s to **9.1 s** (Stage 3 8.7 → 1.2 s,
Stage 4 12.2 → 5.2 s with the cube reused). Whole measurement 124 s → 107 s. Stage 1
is ~50 s of that and runs once either way, so this is not primarily a speed change.

## 3.3 `service/` — a compute service, and the web app driving it

New: `service/app.py` and `service/jobs.py`, plus `serve.sh`. Documented in
[`../../web/running_the_web_app.md`](../../web/running_the_web_app.md).

A job is a `work/<job_id>/` directory — the same layout every manual run uses — so
`stagerun.py` *is* the backend rather than a second implementation of it, and any
job can be inspected or re-run from a terminal. Stages run as subprocesses: the
service learns which stage is running without parsing logs, and a process that exits
guarantees its VRAM is released.

The flow mirrors the pipeline's own shape rather than flattening it. An upload runs
Stage 0 alone and stops at the framing gate; the user sees which photos failed and
why; Stages 1–6 then run with `--no-cut`; the user confirms or moves the plane;
Stages 3–6 re-run with `--cut-only`.

## 3.4 Stage 0 reports *how* a frame passed, and the overlay stops contradicting it

`framing.json` frames gained a `mode` field. "Accepted" was covering two different
outcomes — a frame this stage could crop itself, versus one that only survived
because VGGT's own centre crop happens to keep the reference. The second loses
whatever that crop removes, and a reviewer could not tell them apart.

The overlay was also drawing the *proposed* window while the verdict was reached
against VGGT's. A frame could be labelled "cube not contained" while the drawn box
plainly contained the cube. It now draws the window the verdict was actually reached
on, with the unused proposal in grey.


## 3.5 The viewer reads both Stage 6 schemas, and can no longer be blanked by a bad scale

Reverting Stage 6 changed the CSV's column names, and the web app read the old
ones. The failure was much worse than a missing number.

`linearScale` computed `REFERENCE_CM / ((obb_b + obb_c) / 2)`. With those columns
absent the parser yielded 0 for each, so the expression evaluated to
`14.0 / 0` — **Infinity**. That was handed to `usePly`, which multiplies every
vertex by it, producing a geometry of `NaN`. The result was a blank viewport with
**no error anywhere**: the fetch had succeeded, the PLY had parsed, and the scene
was simply destroyed afterwards. Samples kept working because their CSV predates
the revert, which made it look like a problem with live data transport rather than
with interpretation.

Three changes:

- `parseVolumesCsv` detects which stage wrote the file — `obb_b` present or not —
  and normalises both shapes, keeping an `aabb` flag so the difference is not
  silently lost. Main's vertical axis is `ext_z`, the scene having been levelled.
- `linearScale` mirrors the derivation of whichever stage produced the file. For
  the parked method that is the fitted-face horizontals; for main's it is
  `k = real_vol_cm3 / volume`, `linear_scale = k^(1/3)`. It does **not** use
  main's extents, which are axis-aligned and on a tilted cube measure the
  diagonal: they give 44.0 cm/unit against a true 59.8, a 26% error.
- It returns `null` rather than a non-finite number, and the viewport renders a
  message instead of nothing.

Mirroring matters more than picking the better method here. If the viewer scaled
geometry differently from the stage that computed the volumes, an object would
appear at a size contradicting its own printed measurement, with no way to tell
which was wrong.

| CSV | derivation | cm/unit |
|---|---|---|
| parked Stage 6 (sample) | fitted-face horizontals | 59.79 |
| main's Stage 6 (live job) | `k^(1/3)` volume ratio | 60.86 |
| main's Stage 6, via its extents | *rejected* — AABB diagonal | 44.01 |

Verified on a real `awaiting-cut` job: 296 marker points, 14,257 kept, cut at
21.45 cm, no error box — and the sample still renders unchanged.

Related, from the same investigation: `usePly` had always captured its load errors
at line 99 and nothing rendered them, so a 404 on a mesh also produced a silent
blank. `CutReview` and `MeshView` draw inside the Canvas and cannot show DOM, so
they now pass the failure up through `onLoadError` to the `Viewport`, which also
detects a missing WebGL context — the state an editor preview pane produces, and
which looks identical to every other blank.

The scale rows that used to head this table have been removed, because Stage 6 is
back on main's derivation and they no longer describe what runs. For the record,
they read: reference volume error −10.7% (main) → −4.7% → −1.54%, and an independent
marker cross-check reproducible to 0.24% across two captures. Recovering those means
adopting some part of the parked block; the case for it is §1.1, §1.2 and §2.4.

With main's Stage 6 active, the reference cube reports **exactly 2744.00 cm³** on
every run, because scale is derived as `(real_vol / mesh_vol)^(1/3)` from that same
cube. That is not an accuracy result — it is an identity. The stage currently emits
no error signal about itself.

Cold full run, `inputs/small_leg`, after the revert: 80 s wall, 5 of 6 frames
accepted, 302 marker points, plane 18.4°, alpha 55× watertight with euler 2, limb
1091.79 cm³.

---

# What did NOT change

**Stages 0–5, across the Stage 6 revert.** Verified rather than assumed: Stages 3–5
were re-run after the revert and their meshes byte-compared against copies taken
before it — `leg_mesh.ply`, `box_mesh.ply`, `scene_mesh.ply` and `leg_no_cut.ply`
all identical, same cut, same 302 marker points. A cold run from an empty `work/`
reproduces the same meshes again.

**The volume arithmetic.** Layer 2 added a cross-check and a diagnostic block to
`compute_volumes` and left the integration alone; limb volumes were bit-identical
across those edits. That whole file is now main's anyway.

---

# Open, and not fixed

1. **Stage 6 is unresolved by design** — reverted to main's version pending review
   by the stage's author. While it is, scale comes from the volume ratio, the
   reference agrees with itself by construction, and dimensions come from an
   axis-aligned box, which reports the 14 cm cube as 19.18 × 19.47 × 14.09 cm
   because an AABB around a tilted cube measures its diagonal.
2. **Two Stage 6 CSV schemas are in circulation.** The viewer handles both
   (§3.5), but they are not equivalent: main's scale comes from a volume ratio
   and its extents are axis-aligned, so displayed centimetres differ by ~2% and
   reported dimensions by much more — the 14 cm cube reads 19.18 × 19.47 × 14.09.
   This resolves when Stage 6 does.
3. ~~**The two entry points disagree on identical input.**~~ **Closed
   2026-08-22.** The guess recorded here — "most likely a Stage 0 or Stage 3
   argument one caller passes and the other does not" — was right in shape and
   wrong in detail. It was not an argument: `stagerun.py` ran Stage 0, wrote the
   crops, and then handed Stage 1 the **raw photographs anyway**, so the whole
   framing stage was discarded on that path while `orchestrator.py:207` chained it
   correctly. That is why `run.py` read 1081.94 cm³ and `stagerun.py` read
   1091.79 — they were measuring different pixels.

   Fixed by chaining Stage 0's output into the next stage inside a range
   (`stagerun.py`, `run_stage_range`). Re-measured on `inputs/small_leg` after the
   fix, both entry points now produce **bit-identical** `volumes.csv` —
   `leg_cut.ply` at `0.00479626174799353` mesh units and **1081.9362025528196
   cm³** from both, `box.ply` at `0.012164249800904262`. The only difference left
   is row order (`run.py` writes the limb first, `stagerun.py` the reference),
   which no consumer depends on. The 0.8% is not an error bar on Stage 6; it was
   this bug.
4. **The marker-colour fix is validated on one dataset.** `small_leg` only —
   `est_325` has no band. The claim that a learned colour generalises to a red or
   blue marker is argued but not demonstrated; a capture with a differently
   coloured band is the test.
5. **No error bar on reported volume.** The horizontal-edge disagreement (~1%) is a
   real scale uncertainty and cubes to ~3% on volume. Nothing propagates it.
6. **No held-out object with independent ground truth.** Every accuracy number in
   this document describes the reference cube measuring itself, or internal
   consistency. Nothing here demonstrates the accuracy of a limb measurement, which
   is what the project exists to do.

Carried over from the parked Stage 6 work, and still true of it if adopted: marker
size spread 6.73% with the full-width window against 3.86% without;
`REFERENCE_MARKER_CM` unset pending a ruler measurement of the black square
(predicted 6.5 ± 0.1 cm); limb voxel cross-check at +9.34%, outside the +1–8%
expectation.

# Appendix — the mathematics, stage by stage

Merged in from `update.md` (written 2026-08-12, deleted after the merge — this
appendix is the surviving copy), which answered the same question
as this document and is now folded into it rather than kept alongside. It goes
deeper than the sections above on the **committed** work — every constant with the
measurement that produced it — and it is the reference to read when you need the
derivation rather than the summary.

Two things to hold in mind while reading it:

- It **predates Layers 2 and 3**. Stage 0, the compute service, the deferred cut and
  the band-colour fix are not in it; those are covered above.
- Its **Stage 6 section describes the parked method**, not what runs. Stage 6 has
  since been reverted to main's version — see the STATUS banner at the top of this
  document and `stage06_experiments.md`.

---

### 1. Stage 1 — VGGT inference

### 1.1 Checkpoint licensing

`main` unconditionally fetched `facebook/VGGT-1B`, which is **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 —
non-commercial only**. For a project that may be presented or deployed, that is
a licensing defect, not a preference.

Now `_load_weights()` prefers `facebook/VGGT-1B-Commercial`
(`vggt_1B_commercial.pt`) under the `vggt-aup-license`, falling back only on
failure — and the fallback is **loud**, because silently continuing on the
non-commercial checkpoint is exactly the failure mode that matters:

```python
if VGGT_USE_COMMERCIAL:
    try:
        path = hf_hub_download(VGGT_COMMERCIAL_REPO, VGGT_COMMERCIAL_FILE)
        return torch.load(path, map_location="cpu", weights_only=True)
    except Exception as e:
        print("  WARNING: falling back to facebook/VGGT-1B — CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, "
              "NOT licensed for commercial use.")
```

The commercial repo is **gated**: it needs the licence accepted on the model
page plus `HF_TOKEN` in the environment.

The commercial checkpoint's Acceptable Use Policy forbids unlicensed medical or
health-professional practice and inferring health data without consent. That is
directly relevant to limb measurement and is recorded in `config.py`.

### 1.2 Preprocessing mode

VGGT takes a fixed **518 × 518** input. `main` used only `crop`: scale width to
518, centre-crop the height.

On a 9:16 phone photo, cropping to square discards

$$1 - \frac{9/16}{1} \;\approx\; 44\%$$

of every frame's vertical field of view. On a standing limb that routinely
amputates the subject. `run_inference()` now accepts
`preprocess_mode ∈ {crop, pad}` and `input_res`, exposed as `--preprocess-mode`
and `--input-res`.

**Input:** folder of JPG/PNG/HEIC.
**Output:** `predictions.npz` — `world_points (S,H,W,3)`, `world_points_conf
(S,H,W)`, `depth`, `depth_conf`, `images`, `extrinsic`, `intrinsic`.

---

### 2. Stage 2 — point cloud export

`main` wrote two PLYs (raw and pre-filtered). Now it writes **one**,
`points.ply`, because ghost reduction moved into Stage 3 where it runs *per
identified cluster* — the box and the limb have different densities and must not
share a voxel size derived from their union.

### 2.1 Adaptive confidence threshold

Rather than a fixed cutoff, the threshold is a **percentile of the observed
confidence distribution**:

$$\tau = \operatorname{percentile}\big(\mathrm{conf},\; p\big), \qquad
\text{keep } \{i : \mathrm{conf}_i \ge \tau \;\wedge\; \mathrm{conf}_i > 10^{-5}\}$$

with `p = --conf_thres` (default 45). A fixed absolute threshold does not
transfer between scenes because VGGT's confidence scale shifts with texture and
lighting.

### 2.2 Multi-view consistency — built, measured, disabled

`pipeline/multiview.py` implements the standard idea: reproject each 3D point
into every other view and require its depth to be corroborated by at least
`MULTIVIEW_MIN_VIEWS` others within `MULTIVIEW_REL_THRESHOLD` relative error.

**It does not work here, and the reason is worth keeping.** Measured on
`small_leg`, using local shell thickness (std of point distance to a locally
fitted plane) as the ghost metric:

| `min_views` | points | shell std |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 527,769 | 0.72 mm |
| 2 | 446,218 | 0.73 mm |
| 3 | 311,760 | 0.72 mm |

Discarding **41%** of the cloud changed shell thickness by nothing. The method
assumes each view's errors are independent, so a wrong point fails
corroboration. VGGT's ghost sheet is *the same model making the same mistake in
every view* — the views agree with each other and the ghost passes cleanly.

`MULTIVIEW_MIN_VIEWS = 0`. Kept in the tree as a genuine self-consistency
diagnostic, not as a ghost filter.

---

### 3. Stage 3 — segment, detect, cut, close

This stage absorbed the largest change (+713 lines). It is now three explicit
phases.

### Phase A — cluster in original VGGT space

`main` levelled the scene first, then clustered. Levelling depends on a RANSAC
floor fit, so a bad fit corrupted the clustering that everything downstream
depends on. Clustering now runs **before** levelling, in raw VGGT coordinates,
and is therefore coordinate-system agnostic.

#### 3.1 Dominant-plane removal — the band fix

Objects rest on the floor, so DBSCAN links every object *through the ground* and
returns one blob. The floor must be removed first.

`main` removed the RANSAC **inliers** — a band one threshold thick:

$$\text{remove } \{p : |\,\hat{n}\cdot p + d\,| \le \tau\}, \qquad
\tau = 3 \cdot \operatorname{median}(\text{NN distance})$$

**This is the single most consequential bug fixed.** VGGT ghosts the floor the
same way it ghosts the limb, so the floor is a *sandwich* roughly two thresholds
thick. Removing the middle leaves both skins. Measured on `small_leg`:

```
signed distance from the fitted plane, points surviving a 1x removal
  [-0.010, -0.005)   20,080
  [-0.005, +0.005)      614      <- the band that was removed
  [+0.005, +0.010)   21,669
```

41,749 leftover points form a full-size slab of floor. DBSCAN then welded the
limb, the cube and that slab into one cluster, which Stage 3 exported *as the
limb*. Every symptom downstream followed from this: the "limb" cloud was
182,234 points, deeper (0.86) than it was tall (0.76); the cube appeared to
float 0.45 units above the floor; the reference's two horizontal edges disagreed
by **122%**; no reconstruction method could close the mesh at any α.

The fix removes a **band around the fitted plane**, not the inlier set:

$$\text{remove } \{p : |\,\hat{n}\cdot p + d\,| \le \tau \cdot \beta\},
\qquad \beta = \texttt{PLANE\_REMOVAL\_BAND\_MULT} = 2.0$$

Evidence for β = 2:

| β | removed | next dominant plane |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 260,450 | **the same floor**, \|n·n_floor\| = 1.000 |
| 2 | 302,565 | a wall, \|n·n_floor\| = 0.194 |
| 3 | 309,767 (+7,202 only) | — |
| 4 | 312,524 (+2,757 only) | — |

At β = 2 the floor stops reappearing and the gain flattens; past that it starts
eating whatever rests on the floor.

The RANSAC itself is GPU-batched and deterministic — all 1000 hypotheses are
scored in one chunked matmul under a seeded `torch.Generator`, so runs are
reproducible.

#### 3.2 Adaptive cluster scoring

`main` scored clusters with magic constants:

```python
score = npts/1000 * 0.5 + min(density, 5e6)/1e6 * 0.3 - max_dim * 0.2
```

Those constants encode an assumed scale. A cloud twice as dense scores twice as
high for no physical reason. Scoring is now **normalised by the data's own
medians**, so it is scale-free:

$$
s_i = 0.4\,\frac{N_i}{\operatorname{med}(N)}
    + 0.3\,\frac{\rho_i}{\operatorname{med}(\rho)}
    + 0.3\,\left(1 - \frac{D_i}{\max_j D_j}\right)
$$

where $N$ = point count, $\rho$ = density, $D$ = max extent. The third term
rewards compactness. Note the sign change: `main` *subtracted* raw `max_dim`
(units-dependent); this adds a normalised compactness score in [0, 1].

Box identification uses **cubeness** $= \min(\text{extent}) / \max(\text{extent})$
plus an ArUco-likeness score. After the band fix, on `small_leg`:

```
cluster #1: 112,468 pts, cubeness=0.7315  ->  OBJ
cluster #2:  60,651 pts, cubeness=0.8577  ->  BOX   extent (0.313, 0.328, 0.365)
```

#### 3.3 Ghost reduction — `pipeline/ghost.py` (new)

Two steps, per cluster.

**Voxel dedup.** Voxel size is derived from the cloud, not fixed:

$$v = f \cdot \operatorname{mean}\big(\text{NN distance}\big), \qquad
f = \texttt{GHOST\_VOXEL\_FACTOR} = 0.65$$

Points are hashed to $\lfloor (p - p_{\min}) / v \rfloor$ and one representative
kept per cell. This is the pipeline's dominant decimation step. Measured
combined output across box and limb:

```
1.5  -> ~13k pts   (original main behaviour — faceted meshes)
0.75 -> ~26k
0.65 -> current
0.5  -> ~59k
0.35 -> ~120k
0    -> disabled
```

**Normal-aware filter.** A point whose normal disagrees with its neighbourhood's
mean normal sits on a different sheet from its neighbours. For point $i$ with
unit normal $n_i$ and $k = 20$ nearest neighbours:

$$\bar{n}_i = \frac{1}{k}\sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} n_j, \qquad
\hat{\bar{n}}_i = \frac{\bar{n}_i}{\|\bar{n}_i\|}, \qquad
\delta_i = 1 - \big|\,n_i \cdot \hat{\bar{n}}_i\,\big|$$

Reject when $\delta_i > 0.3$. The absolute value makes it orientation-blind, so
a consistently-flipped normal is not punished.

This was rewritten from a Python loop to a fully vectorised form — one batched
KD-tree query for all points, then `einsum` for the dot products:

```python
_, idx = cKDTree(points).query(points, k=k, workers=-1)   # (N, k)
mean_n = normals[idx].mean(axis=1)
dev = 1.0 - np.abs(np.einsum("ij,ij->i", normals, mean_n))
```

**Known limitation:** this cannot remove the ghost sheet. The ghost is
*parallel* to the true surface, so its normals agree with the neighbourhood and
δ stays small. It removes edge noise and stragglers only.

#### 3.4 MLS surface projection — `pipeline/ghost.py` (new; lived in `pipeline/mls.py` until 2026-08-23)

Since neither multi-view consistency nor normal filtering can see a parallel
ghost, the ghost is collapsed rather than deleted. Each point is projected onto
a locally fitted quadratic surface.

For point $p_i$, take neighbours within radius $r = m \cdot \bar{s}$ where
$\bar{s}$ is mean NN spacing and $m = \texttt{MLS\_RADIUS\_MULT} = 4.0$:

1. Centroid $c$; SVD of the centred neighbourhood $Q - c = U\Sigma V^\top$.
   Local frame: $u = v_1$, $w = v_2$, normal $n = v_3$ (least-variance
   direction).
2. Tangent coordinates $a = (q-c)\cdot u$, $b = (q-c)\cdot w$, height
   $h = (q-c)\cdot n$.
3. Least-squares fit of a degree-2 height field:

   $$h \approx c_0 + c_1 a + c_2 b + c_3 a^2 + c_4 ab + c_5 b^2$$

4. Evaluate at the point's own $(a_i, b_i)$ and move it there:

   $$p_i' = c + a_i u + b_i w + h(a_i, b_i)\, n$$

Both sheets collapse onto one surface; where they are equally populated the
result lands between them.

**The radius must exceed the ghost separation** or the two sheets never share a
neighbourhood — at $m = 2.0$ nothing moved at all. This *moves* points, so it is
a genuine change to geometry, not a cleanup, and it costs volume. Measured on
`small_leg` (shell std / convex hull volume):

| `MLS_RADIUS_MULT` | shell std | hull vol | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| off | 0.93 mm | 1922 cm³ | — |
| 3.0 | 0.60 mm | 1887 cm³ | −1.8% |
| **4.0** | **0.41 mm** | 1833 cm³ | −4.6% |
| 6.0 | 0.29 mm | 1788 cm³ | −7.0% |

Whether that shrinkage removes noise or real surface is **unresolved** — it
depends on whether the true surface is the inner or the outer sheet, which we
cannot currently determine.

### 3.5 Marker detection — rewritten

The marker band defines where the measurement stops. `main`'s rule was:

```python
hsv_mask = (s > 15) & (h > 60)        # h in degrees, 0..360
exg_mask = (2*g - r - b) > 10
marker   = hsv_mask | exg_mask
```

`h > 60` is **upper-open**: it accepts hue 60–360°, every colour except red,
orange and yellow — 83% of the wheel. There is no brightness floor at all. Hue
is computed as a ratio of channel differences to the channel maximum,

$$H = 60 \cdot \left(\frac{G-B}{\Delta} \bmod 6\right) \text{ etc.}, \qquad
S = \frac{\Delta}{\max}, \qquad V = \max$$

so as $V \to 0$ the hue becomes **numerically arbitrary**. On `small_leg` this
classified:

| what | RGB | ExG | hue | V | old rule |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| shadow | (8, 6, 8) | −4 | 300° | **3.1%** | passes |
| shadow | (15, 11, 12) | −5 | 345° | 5.9% | passes |
| skin | (139, 87, 89) | −54 | **358°** | 54.5% | passes |
| **band** | (60, 52, 30) | **+14** | 44° | 23.5% | passes (via ExG) |

The shadow cluster reached 3,349 supporting points against 197 for the real
band, so it won the cut and the pipeline measured a slab of ankle.

The new rule is an actual green test with a brightness floor on **both** paths:

```python
bright   = v > MARKER_VAL_MIN                                    # 15%
hsv_mask = bright & (s > MARKER_SAT_MIN) & (hue_min < h < hue_max)   # 70..180°
exg_mask = bright & (exg > MARKER_EXG_MIN)                       # 10
```

**Critical detail:** the hue window is *not* what finds the marker. The
`small_leg` band is khaki, hue 44°, and fails every green hue test. **ExG** finds
it — $2G - R - B = +14$ against skin at −54. Raising `MARKER_EXG_MIN` to 15
silently lost the only real marker in the dataset. It stays at 10.

Two geometric plausibility gates were added:

- **`MARKER_MIN_CLUSTER_PTS = 40`** (was hardcoded 150). A real band is small —
  99 points out of 182k, because only the camera-facing arc reconstructs. 150
  rejected it; the old loose colour rule only ever cleared 150 by padding
  clusters with shadow.
- **`MARKER_MIN_HEIGHT_FRAC = 0.20`** — reject planes in the bottom 20% of the
  object's height. Feet, arch shadows and the floor junction live there.

  This gate runs in `clean.py` **after** `R_total`, not inside
  `segment_point_cloud`. Detection runs in original VGGT space, where the
  vertical axis is whatever the camera gave — on `small_leg` the limb's long
  axis is **Y**, not Z — so a Z-based height test there measures sideways. Only
  after levelling does "height" mean height.

Result on `leg_conf45`:

| | old | new |
|---|---|---|
| marker points | 1,402 | 249 |
| via HSV rule | 1,298 | **0** |
| planes accepted | 2 (one spurious, 3349 pts) | **1** |

The surviving plane is 99 pts at 44.3% of height, normal
`[−0.206, −0.246, −0.947]` — matching the last known-good fixture (43.3%,
`[−0.203, −0.246, −0.948]`) to three decimals.

**Honest caveat:** ExG separates this khaki band from this skin tone by ~24
units. Real but not large, and it is one subject. A saturated green band would
move the margin to hundreds and let the hue rule earn its place.

### 3.6 Plane fitting

Each marker cluster is spatially separated by **DBSCAN** (ε = 0.03, min_samples
= 10), then a plane is fitted by **SVD**: for centred cluster points $Q - c$,
the unit normal is the **last right singular vector** $v_3$ — the direction of
least variance. This handles tilted and slanted bands correctly, which a
horizontal-slice cut cannot.

### Phase B — levelling

RANSAC the floor, build the rotation taking its normal to $+Z$ via Rodrigues:

$$R = I + [v]_\times + [v]_\times^2\,\frac{1-c}{s^2}, \qquad
v = \hat{n} \times \hat{z},\; s = \|v\|,\; c = \hat{n}\cdot\hat{z}$$

**Bug fixed (`R_total`).** An upside-down scene triggers a 180° flip *after* the
first rotation. `main` applied the flip to the cloud but kept the original `R`
for the marker planes, so the cut plane was rotated into the wrong frame — it
cut 99 mm off the wrong end. The combined rotation is now tracked:

```python
R_total = np.asarray(R, dtype=np.float64)
## ... in the flip branch:
R_total = np.asarray(flip_R, dtype=np.float64) @ R_total
```

`R_total` is applied to the cloud **and** the marker planes, and the levelled
planes are published to `debug/cutting_line_levelled.json` — because
`cutting_line.json` is written pre-levelling while `leg_no_cut.ply` is written
post-levelling, so the two do not share a frame.

### Phase C — cut and close

#### 3.7 The cut rule — rewritten

`main` used a **centroid-side** rule: keep points whose signed distance shares
the sign of the cloud centroid's. One rule for 1, 2 and n markers.

That is fine for a one-shot run but has three defects, all of which bite once a
user can move the plane in the web UI:

1. Dragging a plane past the centroid **inverts the entire selection** in one
   step.
2. Two planes only mean "keep between" when the centroid already sits between
   them. Put both above it and each independently keeps the below-side.
3. The user cannot overrule a centroid that lands on the wrong side of a
   lopsided cloud.

The rule is now stated in terms of **height**, which is a property of the scene
rather than of the cloud's mass distribution:

```
0 markers  ->  no cut
1 marker   ->  keep what is BELOW the plane
2 markers  ->  keep what is BETWEEN the two planes
>2         ->  trimmed to the 2 best-supported (by npts)
```

Each normal is flipped to point along world up first, so the detected normal's
sign cannot change the outcome:

$$\hat{n} \leftarrow \operatorname{sign}(\hat{n}\cdot \hat{u})\,\hat{n},
\qquad d_i = \hat{n}\cdot p_i - \hat{n}\cdot c$$

- 1 plane: keep $d_i \le 0$.
- 2 planes: keep $(d_i^{(1)} \le 0) \oplus (d_i^{(2)} \le 0)$ — **XOR**. A point
  between the planes is below the upper and above the lower, so exactly one test
  is true. No ordering of the planes is needed.

A plane with $|\hat{n}\cdot\hat{u}| < 10^{-3}$ stands vertical, has no above or
below, and is skipped rather than guessed at.

Verified on a synthetic 1001-point cloud: normal sign irrelevant, plane order
irrelevant, third marker trimmed, tilted normals correct.

`MAX_MARKERS = 2`, enforced in `clean.py` before the planes are published, so
the cut, the cross-section caps and the JSON all see the same set.

#### 3.8 Closing order — moved after the cut

The floor extension and bottom cap fabricate a base at floor level. That is
correct **only when the floor really is the bottom of the region being
measured**, which depends on the cut:

| markers | bottom of kept region | who closes it |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | the floor | floor extend + bottom cap |
| 1 | the floor (keep-below) | floor extend + bottom cap |
| 2 | the lower cut face | `cap_points_on_plane` |

`main` filled before cutting, which got the 2-marker case wrong. The fabricated
skirt was usually discarded by the cut and merely wasted — but a marker placed
low on the limb left part of it *inside* the kept segment: invented geometry in
the middle of a measurement, and a lower face that bulged instead of sitting
flat.

`leg_no_cut.ply` is exempt and always floor-closed — it is the review cloud and
what gets measured if the user declines to cut — so it is built from its own
copy while the cut runs on the unfilled cloud.

Verified on the real cloud, both branches:

```
2 markers: case_2_between -> 19,130 pts, both cut lines capped, NO floor  -> 28,951
1 marker:  case_1_below   -> 15,654 pts, cut line capped + floor closed   -> 86,299
```

#### 3.9 `extend_point_cloud_to_floor` (new)

Capping at the raw $z_{\min}$ would seal the object *above* the ground and lose
the shadowed base entirely. So the bottom band (lowest `band_frac = 10%` of
height) is swept downward in discrete levels to the detected floor $z_f$.

Refuses to run when the gap exceeds `max_gap_frac = 35%` of object height —
that means the floor fit is suspect, and extending would fabricate a long
skirt. This guard is what printed
`[box] floor gap 0.4479 > 35% of height 0.1381 — skipping extension` while the
floor bug was still present.

#### 3.10 `cap_points_on_plane` (new)

Fills the exposed cut cross-section. The 2-D basis is derived from the **marker
normal**, not from world axes:

$$u \perp n, \quad w = n \times u$$

so a tilted cut is capped in its own plane. Left open, the surface solver rounds
the cut into a dome instead of the flat face the cut actually produced.

#### 3.11 Bottom cap density

`cap_point_cloud_bottom` tiles a grid inside the bottom cross-section's alpha
hull. `main` sized that grid from `avg_spacing` — the cloud's own point density.

Reasonable at the time, but that is a **measurement, not a constant**. When
Stage 3 stopped downsampling, spacing went from ~0.007 to 0.00173. Grid count
scales as $1/s^2$, so the cap grew ~16× to **100,559 points** — 77% of the whole
cut cloud was fabricated floor, handed to Delaunay as a dense coplanar slab,
which is its degenerate input.

Fixed in two parts:

$$s_{\text{cap}} = \operatorname{clip}(\bar{s}, 0.0005, 0.005)\cdot
\texttt{CAP\_SPACING\_MULT}, \qquad \texttt{CAP\_SPACING\_MULT} = 3.0$$

Safe because the smallest α multiplier is 8× spacing, so a 3× gap is still
bridged.

Then the count is **bounded**, because the multiplier alone is not safe at both
ends — the cube's underside is pressed against the floor and barely
reconstructs, so 3× took its cap from 150 points to **16**:

$$n_{\text{est}} = \frac{A_{\text{hull}}}{s_{\text{cap}}^2}, \qquad
s_{\text{cap}} \leftarrow \sqrt{A_{\text{hull}} / n_{\text{target}}}
\;\text{ if } n_{\text{est}} \notin [200,\ 20000]$$

Result:

```
box:  hull area 0.00150   ->    203 pts   (was 16)
leg:  hull area 0.29934   -> 10,107 pts   (was 100,559)
```

The point-in-polygon test was also vectorised via `shapely.contains_xy`,
replacing one Python-level `hull.contains(Point(pt))` call per grid cell
(>100k calls).

---

### 4. Stage 4 — reconstruction

### 4.1 Default changed: Poisson → alpha shape

Poisson fits a smooth **approximating** implicit surface. That smoothness prior
rounds off flat faces and sharp rims, losing real volume — bad for a cube whose
edge length *is* the measurement.

Alpha shape **interpolates**: the surface passes through the actual points, so
sharp features survive.

### 4.2 Alpha selection on Euler number — not watertightness

This is the most important correctness change in Stage 4.

`main` had no α search. The naive fix is "first α that returns triangles", which
picks the smallest and returns a shredded non-manifold shell (**−91%** on a known
can).

The next-naive fix is "first watertight α". **Watertightness alone is not
sufficient.** A surface riddled with tunnels is still closed, and the
signed-volume integral faithfully subtracts those tunnels — so the mesh looks
like a perfect cube from outside while reporting far too little volume.

The **Euler characteristic** is the decisive test:

$$\chi = V - E + F$$

$\chi = 2$ is a simple closed surface (genus 0). $\chi = 2 - 2g$ for genus $g$,
so each tunnel costs 2. Measured on the reference cube:

| α | watertight | χ | volume |
|---|---|---|---|
| 30× | ✅ | **−1** | 1898 cm³ |
| 40× | ✅ | **2** | 2467 cm³ |

Against a 2744 cm³ nominal, selecting on watertightness alone would have
under-read by 31%. Selection is now **smallest α with watertight AND χ = 2**,
over `ALPHA_MULTIPLIERS = [8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 20, 25, 30, 40, 55, 70, 90]`.

### 4.3 Delaunay reuse — 4.3× speedup

Alpha shape is computed *from* a Delaunay tetrahedralisation. `main`'s structure
rebuilt it for every α. 3-D Delaunay on surface-sampled points is pathological
(a 42× slowdown was measured), so it is now built **once** and reused:

```python
tetra, pt_map = o3d.geometry.TetraMesh.create_from_point_cloud(pcd)
m = o3d.geometry.TriangleMesh.create_from_point_cloud_alpha_shape(
        pcd, alpha, tetra, pt_map)
```

### 4.4 Largest-component filter before the Euler check

Stray fragments each contribute their own $\chi = 2$, so a mesh with debris can
score $\chi = 6$ and be rejected despite a perfectly good main body. The
component filter now runs **before** the topology test.

### 4.5 `_post_process` must not undo the selection

`_post_process` calls `remove_non_manifold_edges()`, which deletes every
triangle touching a non-manifold edge — and that can tear a closed surface open.
Since α was chosen *because* the mesh was watertight with χ = 2, letting cleanup
undo that discards the whole point of the search.

The mesh is now snapshotted before the destructive steps and restored if they
open it. Safe: a watertight surface has exactly one component, so the component
filter had nothing to remove anyway.

The guard uses **trimesh's** definition of watertight, not Open3D's. They
disagree — the `small_leg` mesh at α = 25× is watertight to trimesh (χ = 2) and
not to Open3D, which is stricter about vertex-manifoldness. The α search, Stage
5 and Stage 6 all use trimesh, so guarding on Open3D would protect a property
nothing downstream reads.

### 4.6 Other

- `ball_pivot` removed entirely — never produced a usable mesh.
- `MAX_RECON_POINTS = 90000` as a named constant, replacing two magic `150000`
  literals.
- `workers/recons_worker.py` deleted (−164 lines), superseded by
  `recons_methods_worker.py`.

---

### 5. Stage 5 — watertight repair

PyMeshFix repair, with one behavioural change: it now reports **honestly**
when repair was skipped because the mesh was already closed.

```
box: already watertight — repair skipped (5,645 verts, 11,286 faces)
```

That line is a useful signal in the other direction too: if repair *fires*,
Stage 4 struggled, and the result deserves suspicion.

---

### 6. Stage 6 — real-world volume

Renumbered from Stage 7.

### 6.0 The reference's edge comes from FITTED FACES, not a bounding box

**The largest accuracy change in Stage 6.** `pipeline/core/faces.py` (new).

An oriented bounding box has to guess the object's orientation. On the reference
cube it guessed ~1.3 degrees wrong — enough to enclose **6.8% more volume than
the convex hull of the same points**. An OBB must *contain* the hull, so that
excess is pure fitting error:

```
face-to-face box       2505.7 cm3    the cube's real size
convex hull of points  2479.2 cm3    -1.1%
oriented bounding box  2647.8 cm3    +5.7%
```

Both libraries fail: Open3D's `get_oriented_bounding_box` returned **2.1x the
AABB volume** on this cloud, trimesh's +5.7%. Spread over three axes that is
+2.2% per edge, and since `linear_scale = 14.0 / edge`, it under-read every
volume by ~6%.

A cube does not need a bounding box — its face normals *are* its axes. The new
module clusters mesh triangles by normal (area-weighted, so the many tiny corner
triangles cannot outvote a real face), pairs opposite faces, and measures their
separation **through the mesh centroid** — because opposite faces splay by about
a degree, and differencing plane offsets instead measures the gap extrapolated
away from the object (0.265 units against a true 0.252). Verified exact on a
synthetic cube rotated 30/20 degrees.

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| cube, leg scene | 2460.1 cm3 (-10.3%) | **2694.2 cm3 (-1.8%)** |
| cube, can scene | 2449.9 cm3 (-10.7%) | **2643.6 cm3 (-3.7%)** |
| horizontal edges agree to | 2.68% / 1.46% | **0.79% / 1.14%** |

Falls back to the OBB with an explicit warning below two face pairs. Reference
only — meaningless for a limb.

A **squareness gate** was added alongside: the three edges as shares of their sum
should be 33.33% each, and a horizontal deviating more than 2 pp now warns. It is
scale-free and needs no ground truth. It is deliberately *not* used as a
correction — normalising to 100% makes common-mode error invisible, which is the
exact defect above.

### 6.1 Scale derivation — the important maths

`main` derived scale from a **volume ratio**:

$$k = \frac{V_{\text{ref,real}}}{V_{\text{ref,mesh}}}, \qquad
\ell = k^{1/3}$$

This is wrong in a subtle and expensive way. It uses $V_{\text{mesh}}^{1/3}$ as
the reference edge length, which only holds for a **perfect cube**, and the cube
root compounds any deviation three times. Measured: at 2.2% off cubic it
under-read the edge by 3.1% and **inflated every volume by ~10%**.

It also **forces the reference's own error to zero** by construction — the
reference always "measures" exactly 2744 cm³, so the system can never report its
own accuracy.

Scale now comes from a measured **length**:

$$\ell = \frac{\texttt{REFERENCE\_REAL\_SIZE\_CM}}{\bar{e}_{\text{horiz}}},
\qquad k = \ell^3, \qquad
V_{\text{real}} = V_{\text{mesh}} \cdot k$$

**Only the two horizontal edges** are averaged. The vertical edge is the axis the
floor truncates — the cube's underside never reconstructs, so including it drags
the estimate small and inflates everything measured against it. Current run:

```
horizontal = 0.2264, 0.2325 units — disagree by 2.68%
vertical   = 0.2192 units (13.37 cm of an expected 14.00), 4.47% short
ref edge   = 0.229427  ->  linear_scale = 14.0 / 0.229427 = 61.02 cm/unit
```

The reference's volume is now **free to disagree** with nominal, and that gap is
a real error bar: **2346 vs 2744 cm³, −14.5%**.

> **A tautology that was found and removed.** An earlier iteration reported all
> three cube dimensions after forcing `side = mean(fx, fy)`. The mean of the

### 6.2 OBB by orientation, not magnitude

`main` used axis-aligned bounds. An AABB around a yaw-rotated object reports its
**diagonal**, not its size: the can measured 6.09 cm wide by AABB against 5.75 cm
by OBB; the cube 14.95 vs 14.0.

Oriented extents are now used, and — importantly — they are ordered by
**orientation, not magnitude**. Index 0 is the axis most aligned with world up:

$$i_v = \arg\max_i \left| \frac{R_{:,i}}{\|R_{:,i}\|} \cdot \hat{z} \right|$$

Stage 3 levels the scene, so that axis is the one the floor truncates.
Identifying it geometrically beats guessing from which edges happen to agree,
which picks the wrong edge whenever two are short in the same direction.

CSV columns were renamed accordingly: `size_a/b/c_cm` → `height_cm` /
`width_cm` / `depth_cm`.

### 6.3 Volume by the divergence theorem

For a closed, consistently-oriented triangle mesh, the exact signed volume is

$$V = \frac{1}{6}\sum_{\text{triangles}} \big(v_0 \times v_1\big)\cdot v_2$$

No discretisation error. This is used whenever the mesh is watertight.

### 6.4 Independent voxel cross-check

Voxel occupancy is computed **alongside** the exact value. It over-reads by a few
percent because boundary voxels are counted whole, and converges downward onto
exact as resolution rises. Expected band: **+1% to +8%**.

A voxel result *below* exact indicates a self-intersecting or inverted surface.
Current run:

```
box.ply      exact 0.010323  voxel 0.010725  +3.89%
leg_cut.ply  exact 0.003746  voxel 0.004078  +8.84%
```

### 6.5 Honest failure reporting

- Non-watertight → explicit warning that flood fill **leaks** through holes and
  can under-read by an order of magnitude while returning a plausible number.
- Convex hull fallback → labelled `convex_hull (UNRELIABLE)` with a warning that
  it ignores the surface entirely, so a broken mesh scores the same as a good
  one.
- χ ≠ 2 → explicit warning that the volume is not reliable.

---

### 6.6 Other fixes found by auditing

**`clean_merged_scene()` tore closed meshes open.** It called
`remove_non_manifold_edges()` unguarded — the same function already guarded in
Stage 4's `_post_process`. Now snapshots and reverts if the mesh was closed
before and is not after.

**`stagerun.py` fed the scene mesh back into Stage 5.** Its glob was
`*_recon.ply`, which matched `scene_recon.ply` — already the merge of both
objects — so every object was merged twice. Coincident duplicate geometry turned
two closed surfaces into **7,554 fragments, euler 3113**. `orchestrator.py`
always passed `recon_mesh_paths` and excluded it, so `run.py` was never affected;
only the experiment harness was. The broken mesh did reach
`web/public/samples/small_leg/scene_mesh.ply` and has been regenerated.

**`MAX_RECON_POINTS = 90000`** replaces two magic `150000` literals in the worker.

**A CSV column broke the web app.** `face_h` is a list, and pandas wrote it as a
quoted comma-containing field; every consumer splits on commas without honouring
quotes, so the reference volume read as "2". Working values are now dropped
before the CSV is written.

### 7. Configuration — every new constant

All 13 constants live in `config.py`, each with the measurement that set it.

| constant | value | why |
|---|---|---|
| `PLANE_REMOVAL_BAND_MULT` | 2.0 | floor is a ghost sandwich ~2 thresholds thick |
| `MARKER_HUE_MIN` / `MAX` | 70 / 180° | bounded green window; old rule was upper-open |
| `MARKER_SAT_MIN` | 25% | washed-out pixels have no reliable hue |
| `MARKER_VAL_MIN` | 15% | hue is numerically arbitrary below this |
| `MARKER_EXG_MIN` | 10 | the rule that actually finds the khaki band |
| `MARKER_MIN_HEIGHT_FRAC` | 0.20 | reject feet / arch shadow / floor junction |
| `MARKER_MIN_CLUSTER_PTS` | 40 | a real band is 99 pts; 150 rejected it |
| `CAP_SPACING_MULT` | 3.0 | cap is flat, needs no surface resolution |
| `CAP_MIN_PTS` / `MAX_PTS` | 200 / 20000 | multiplier alone unsafe at both ends |
| `MLS_RADIUS_MULT` | 4.0 | must exceed ghost separation; 2.0 moved nothing |
| `GHOST_VOXEL_FACTOR` | 0.65 | dominant decimation step |
| `MULTIVIEW_MIN_VIEWS` | 0 | **disabled** — documented failure |
| `VGGT_USE_COMMERCIAL` | True | licensing |

---

### 8. Tooling added

### `stagerun.py` (new, ~550 lines)

Per-stage runner. Runs any stage or range (`3`, `4-6`), reads the previous
stage's output from a different run via `--src`, caches Stage 1, and prints
per-stage metrics: point counts, extents, colour presence, `border_contact`,
`floor_planarity`, `multiview_stats`.

This is what makes the pipeline debuggable — a full run is minutes, a single
stage is seconds.

### `web/` (new)

Next.js 15 / React 19 / three.js 0.172 front end. Three screens that matter:

- **Samples** — precomputed runs, no server needed.
- **Review** — interactive cut adjustment on the ghost-filtered cloud. Mirrors
  `apply_marker_cut` **exactly** client-side so the split updates while
  dragging. Shows the detected marker as a fixed yellow plane alongside the
  editable green cut disc.
- **Result** — measured volume, oriented dimensions, and the reference check.

Coordinate handling is the subtle part: the pipeline is **Z-up**, three.js is
**Y-up**, and the loader recentres the cloud. Anything positioned in the same
space (cut planes especially) must receive the identical transform, which is why
`transformToScene` stores `geom.userData.sceneOffset` and `pointToScene` /
`dirToScene` exist.

Slider angles are folded into the upper hemisphere before use. A plane is
unchanged by negating its *whole* normal but **not** by flipping z alone — reading
tilt as $\arccos|n_z|$ while keeping the original $x,y$ did exactly that, and the
plane visibly reversed the moment any slider moved. Verified: the round trip now
gives $|n \cdot n_0| = 1.0000$ against 0.7963 before.

### Output layout

`orchestrator.py` now publishes final deliverables to the top of `output/`
(`leg_mesh`, `box_mesh`, `scene_mesh` as `.ply` + `.stl`) with everything else
under `for_debug/<NN_stagename>/`.

---

### 9. End-to-end result

`inputs/small_leg`, 6 photos, stages 3–6:

```
       name     method  euler   volume    obb_a    obb_b    obb_c
    box.ply watertight      2 0.010323 0.219166 0.226351 0.232503
leg_cut.ply watertight      2 0.003746 0.508577 0.123537 0.258523

       name  height_cm  width_cm  depth_cm  real_vol_cm3
    box.ply      13.37     13.81     14.19       2345.55
leg_cut.ply      31.03      7.54     15.78        851.28
```

The 14 cm reference cube measures **13.37 × 13.81 × 14.19 cm** on a scale derived
from its own edges — the *shape* being right is independent evidence, not
circular. Both meshes reach Stage 5 already watertight with χ = 2.

---

### 10. Known open issues

1. **Reference error −14.5%** (2346 vs 2744 cm³). Genuine, unforced, and the
   dominant error bar on every other number. Vertical edge reads 13.37 cm —
   0.63 cm the floor extension does not recover.
2. **No compute backend.** The web Upload path probes `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` and
   degrades honestly; the FastAPI service wrapping `stagerun.py` does not exist,
   so browser uploads cannot run the pipeline. Review sliders are display-only.
3. **`est_325` fixtures are stale** — only `small_leg` was regenerated.
4. **No caliper ground truth.** The can's nominal 325 ml is its *fill* volume;
   the pipeline measures external displacement. Different quantities — no error
   percentage is defensible until the can is physically measured.
5. **Review counts are not comparable to the pipeline's.** The browser cuts
   `leg_no_cut.ply` (floor-closed); the pipeline cuts the raw cloud then closes.
   Both correct, but the screen implies they match.
6. **MLS shrinkage is unresolved** — 4.6% of hull volume, and we cannot yet say
   whether it is noise or real surface.
7. **Marker detection rests on a ~24-unit ExG margin** on one subject. A
   saturated green band would make this robust.

# Session log — August 2026

Everything below was established after the layer-by-layer sections above. It is
ordered as it happened, because several findings only make sense as corrections
to earlier ones.

---

## 1. Two entry points, one answer

**The claim it replaced.** This file previously recorded that `run.py` and
`stagerun.py` disagreed by 0.8% on identical input, cause unknown, "not chased
down".

**What it actually was.** `stagerun.py` ran Stage 0, wrote the 518² crops, and
then handed Stage 1 the **original photographs**. The entire framing stage was
computed and discarded on that path, while `pipeline/orchestrator.py:207` chained
it correctly. The two entry points were measuring different pixels.

**After the fix**, both emit a bit-identical `volumes.csv`. This is now the
standing regression test: any change that makes them differ has broken the
chaining.

**Why a gate that is computed and thrown away is worse than no gate**: it reports
success. Stage 0 printed its verdicts, wrote its crops, and the run proceeded —
with none of it in effect.

---

## 2. The reference is measured by its own volume, and what that costs

Stage 6 as it currently ships derives scale from the cube's mesh volume:

```
k            = V_real / V_mesh          =  2744 cm³ / 0.012164 units³
linear_scale = k^(1/3)                  =  60.87 cm per unit
V_subject    = V_subject_mesh × k
```

Substituting the reference into its own formula:

```
V_ref_reported = V_ref_mesh × (V_real / V_ref_mesh) = V_real  ≡  2744.00 cm³
```

**The cube reports 2744.00 on every run by construction.** It is an identity, not
a measurement, and it carries no information about accuracy. Any report quoting
it as evidence of correctness is quoting a tautology.

The alternative — parked in `pipeline/stages/volume.py` — calibrates on a
*measured edge* instead:

```
linear_scale = REFERENCE_REAL_SIZE_CM / mean(two horizontal fitted-face edges)
```

which leaves the cube's volume **free to disagree**, and on `small_leg` it does:
2694 cm³ against 2744 nominal, −1.8%. That residual is the only internal error
signal the system has, and the shipping method sets it to zero by definition.

**Why the cube root matters.** Deriving scale as `(V_real/V_mesh)^(1/3)` uses
`V_mesh^(1/3)` as the edge length, which is exact only for a perfect cube. For a
box of edges `a, b, c` the cube root returns the geometric mean `(abc)^(1/3)`,
and for a reconstruction 2.2% off cubic that under-reads the true edge by about
3.1% — which inflates every reported volume by roughly `1.031³ − 1 ≈ 10%`.

---

## 3. Why alpha shape, and the topology that decides it

> **Updated 2026-08-23 — Poisson is now the default.** The evidence below was
> measured against a Stage 5 that called `pymeshfix.fill_holes()` and never
> `repair()`, which left every Poisson mesh closed but topologically invalid. With

> not watertightness, is what makes a volume meaningful — is unchanged and is
> exactly why the fallback and the Stage 5 warning exist. See `experiments.md`,
> E-psr-adopted.

**The Euler characteristic.** For a triangulated surface,

```
χ = V − E + F
```

and for a closed orientable surface of genus `g`, `χ = 2 − 2g`. So:

- `χ = 2` — a single closed surface with no handles, genus 0. A solid.
- `χ = 0` — one handle. A torus.
- `χ < 0` — many handles, or several components with handles.
- `χ` large and positive — many separate closed pieces.

Only `χ = 2` guarantees that "the volume enclosed" is a single well-defined
quantity. **This is the property Stage 4 searches for**, over a ladder of α from
8× to 200× the mean point spacing, taking the *smallest* α that is both watertight
and `χ = 2` — the tightest surface that is still one solid.

**Watertightness alone is not sufficient, and this was measured.** All three
reconstructors become watertight after the pipeline's own repair. What they close
*into* differs completely:

| method | fits the points (p95) | χ after repair | limb volume |
|---|---|---|---|
| ball pivoting | **0.00 mm** — interpolates every point exactly | **256** | 1410 cm³, **+30.3%** |
| Poisson (PSR) | 1.02 mm | 22 | 1070 cm³, −1.1% |
| alpha shape | 2.39 mm — the *worst* fit | **2** | 1082 cm³ |

Ball pivoting passes through every input point and is 30% wrong. PyMeshFix will
happily close 133 shredded shells into a bag of small separate blobs, and
`is_watertight` returns True for the result. **Fidelity to the data and validity
of the enclosed volume are independent properties**, and only the second one is
what a volume measurement needs.

**Why alpha shape has the guarantee structurally.** An alpha shape is a
subcomplex of the Delaunay tetrahedralisation of the points themselves: a
simplex is included iff its circumsphere is empty and has radius ≤ α. Its
topology therefore comes from the samples. Poisson instead solves

```
∇·(∇χ̃) = ∇·V⃗           for an indicator field χ̃, from an oriented normal field V⃗
```

and extracts an isosurface of `χ̃`. Nothing in that construction constrains the
genus of the result — where the normal field is inconsistent, the isosurface
grows handles. On a **cube** the normal field is inconsistent along every one of
the twelve sharp edges, which is why:

> **Poisson closed the limb at χ = 2 in 36 of 48 parameter configurations, and
> the reference cube in 0 of 48.** Depth 8–11, trim quantile 0–0.10, with and
> without pre-filtering. The cube's χ was 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 22 or 30 — never 2.

And the answer is not stable: across those 48 configurations the reported limb
volume ranged **972 to 1174 cm³, a 21% spread**, against alpha's 2.5%.

**A mixed configuration was tried** — alpha shape for the cube, Poisson for the
limb, which the pipeline already supports via `--box-recon-method` and
`--obj-recon-method`. On `small_leg` both objects reached χ = 2 and the volume
moved −1.0%. On `short_leg` the limb closed at **χ = −4** and the volume moved
−16%. The deciding measurement:

| | Stage 4 → Stage 5 volume change |
|---|---|
| alpha shape, both captures | **+0.00%** — already closed, repair is a no-op |
| Poisson, `small_leg` | −4.22% |
| Poisson, `short_leg` | **+158.08%** |

Poisson's mesh is not closed when Stage 4 hands it over, so **the repair is part
of the answer**. A method whose reported volume is between 4% and 158% the work
of a hole-filling heuristic is not a measurement instrument. Alpha shape never
enters that regime because Stage 4 does not emit anything open.

**One thing Poisson genuinely wins, recorded because it is a real cost of the
current choice**: p95 point-to-surface of 1.30 mm against alpha's 2.39 mm on
`small_leg`, and 1.70 mm against **11.84 mm** on `short_leg`. Alpha buys its
guarantee with a coarse α, and coarse means loose.

---

## 4. The ghost is two groups of cameras, not two copies of a surface

VGGT emits a duplicated surface about 2.7 mm thick. Tagging every point with the
view that produced it — `world_points` is `(S,518,518,3)`, so the source camera is
known by construction — and splitting each 5° wedge at its largest radial gap:

| view | inner sheet | outer sheet |
|---|---|---|
| 0, 1, 3, 5 | **0** | 107 / 45 / 15 / 142 |
| **2, 4** | **264 / 167** | **0** |

**The split is perfect. No wedge mixes them.** Views 2 and 4 place the surface
2.70 mm inside where views 0, 1, 3 and 5 place it, on the reference cube as well
as on the limb. This is not per-pixel noise and not a model artifact in the usual
sense: it is a **systematic registration disagreement between two groups of
cameras**.

**Why it might matter, as arithmetic.** The offset is additive, not
multiplicative, so it does not divide out under calibration. A surface offset δ
inflates a diameter by 2δ. On the cube's ~230 mm edge that is a relative error of
`2δ/230`; on the limb's ~108 mm diameter it is `2δ/108` — **the limb is hit
about twice as hard**. With δ = 1.35 mm (half the sheet separation, which is
where MLS lands):

```
cube:  2 × 1.35 / 230  =  1.17%
limb:  2 × 1.35 / 108  =  2.50%
net on the limb after calibrating on the cube  ≈  1.3% of diameter  ≈  4% of volume
```

**Which sheet is true is unresolved**, and the obvious tests do not settle it:
the sheets are evenly populated (limb 51.9%/48.1%, cube 48.0%/52.0%), the vote is
four views against two but the two contribute more points, and comparing the
groups directly is confounded because they see different faces.

**What would settle it**: the ArUco markers are printed at a known size, so
recovering their 3D corners per view group and comparing against that printed
size says which group has the correct scale. That needs `REFERENCE_MARKER_CM`
measured with a ruler first.

---

## 5. What the ghost chain's three steps actually do

Measured function by function, because the mechanism had been mis-attributed
twice:

| function | in → out | what it really does |
|---|---|---|
| `ghost_voxel_downsample` | 114,282 → 17,979 | **does not remove the ghost.** Two sheets 2.7 mm apart fall in different voxels and both survive. It sets the *point spacing* |
| `normal_aware_filter` | 17,979 → 17,443 | drops points whose normal disagrees with their neighbourhood. −0.08% on the volume: not load-bearing |
| `mls_project` | 17,443 → 17,443 | **this collapses the sheets.** Moves points, deletes none. Shell 1.44 mm → 0.42 mm |

**Why the downsample is load-bearing anyway.** `MLS_RADIUS_MULT` is measured in
multiples of point spacing, so decimating is what converts it into millimetres:

```
spacing 0.94 mm  →  MLS radius 3.75 mm   (barely spans a 2.7 mm ghost)
spacing 2.10 mm  →  MLS radius 8.38 mm   (comfortably spans it)
```

Without the downsample, MLS's neighbourhood is too narrow to hold both sheets at
once and cannot merge them. Removing the step costs **+2.59%** on the reported
volume — measured by setting `GHOST_VOXEL_FACTOR = 0` and re-running from the
same cached Stage 1.

**The 30 lines were replaced by a library call.** `voxel_dedup` and
`open3d.voxel_down_sample` differ only in where the grid is anchored
(`points.min(axis=0)` against Open3D's own origin), which moves a few points
across cell boundaries. Re-measured on the current tree: **0.15% apart** on the
reported volume, 1083.54 against 1081.94. The hand-rolled version is deleted;
`ghost_voxel_downsample` is a thin wrapper that preserves the three contracts a
bare call would lose — the `voxel_size <= 0` escape hatch, uint8 colours, and an
empty cloud returning rather than raising.

**Why the fit is quadratic and not planar.** Both flatten the shell equally
(0.49 mm against 0.42 mm). The difference is curvature: a plane fitted to a
curved surface sits inside it and pulls the outline inward. Over 40 cross-sections
the quadratic preserves **+1.10 pp** more area than the plane — IQR +0.86 to
+1.47, positive in **100%** of them, and stable at +1.0 to +1.2 pp under every
outline statistic tried.

---

## 6. Three claims withdrawn

Recorded in place because a proposal has to survive someone checking it.

**"The cut was 20.8° off perpendicular and is now 1.3°."** The *tilt* column
reproduces — main's detector at 19.73° against 19.7° recorded. The derived
"off perpendicular" figure does not: it comes out 9.4°–12.5° depending on how the
limb's axis is fitted, and swings 10° between two reasonable axis estimates.
**Not quotable.** What does reproduce, and is what the band-colour fix is worth:

| | band points | normal's tilt from vertical |
|---|---|---|
| main's hardcoded khaki window | 193 | 19.73° |
| traced, `dilate=0` — the bug | **45** | **27.06°** |
| traced, `dilate=±3` — ships | **296** | **19.04°** |

The limb's own axis leans 19.01°. The shipping detector matches it to 0.03°; the
bug fits a plane through 45 points and lands 8° out.

**"Plane MLS costs 7.64% of cross-sectional area, the quadratic 6.67%."** The
outline in that figure took the **maximum** radius in each angular wedge, so
every vertex was a single extreme point — which is also why it drew corners a leg
does not have. With a 1.76 mm shell, a max-radius outline traces the *outer* face
of the doubled surface, and MLS collapsing the shell reads as a large area loss
the limb never had. Same points, only the statistic changed:

| per-wedge statistic | area | plane vs no MLS | quadratic vs no MLS |
|---|---|---|---|
| max | 65.3 cm² | **−7.57%** | **−6.41%** |
| mean | 60.9 cm² | −1.41% | −0.50% |
| **median** | 60.7 cm² | **−0.59%** | **+0.42%** |

The max row reproduces the recorded pair to a tenth of a point, which is how the
cause was identified rather than guessed. **The two percentages are withdrawn;
the +1 pp gap between plane and quadratic survives every statistic.**

**"`short_leg` is a badly framed capture."** It is not. Stage 0 rejected 5 of its
8 frames because of a hallucinated marker band, and with that fixed all 8 pass.
Any conclusion that leaned on `short_leg` being a poor capture — including the
excuse offered for Poisson's failure on it — does not hold.

---

## 7. Stage 0's detector was wrong in three ways, and could not read HEIC

**It found a band where there was none.** `_band_bbox` checked only that the
detected box *overlapped* the limb. An open-vocabulary detector always returns
its best candidate for "cord"; with no cord present that candidate is the leg,
which is entirely on the leg, so the test passed trivially. Band area as a
fraction of the limb's mask:

| capture | ratio |
|---|---|
| `small_leg` — a real band | **0.04 – 0.07** |
| `est_325` — no band | 1.23 |
| `short_leg` — no band | 2.19 – 4.02 |

`BAND_MAX_LIMB_FRAC = 0.35`: five times the largest real band, a third of the
smallest false one.

**One detection was enough to set the marker colour.** A single 74 × 60 px false
positive on 1 of 8 `short_leg` frames — small enough to pass the size guard —
taught the pipeline that the marker is RGB(217, 207, 198), which is the floor
tile. Consequence, measured by running Stage 3's detector both ways on the same
cloud:

| marker colour | Stage 3 |
|---|---|
| the spurious floor colour | **198 points, cut at 61% of the limb's height** |
| none at all | **no plane** — the correct answer |

`BAND_MIN_FRAME_FRAC = 0.6`, rounded up: 4 frames of 6, 5 of 8. A fixed count
does not scale — two of six is corroboration, two of twenty is noise.

**A missing band disabled cropping entirely.** `can_crop` required
`band is not None`, making a band a precondition for cropping *at all*. On any
capture without a marker, `can_crop` was always False and Stage 0 silently fell
back to VGGT's own centre crop — the exact failure the stage exists to prevent.

**It could not read HEIC.** `cv2.imread` returns None for HEIC and only
`vggt/utils/load_fn.py` registers the opener, which is Stage 1's loader. Every
frame of a HEIC capture reached Stage 0 as None and was recorded `file
unreadable` — **all 8 of 8 on `est_325`**, a dataset the gate had therefore never
examined.

### The redesign: three verdicts

Two outcomes could not express the situation, because a capture with no marker
band is perfectly measurable — it simply cannot be cut automatically.

| condition | verdict |
|---|---|
| everything found and framed | **pass** |
| band missing, band clipped, or **cube clipped** | **warning** — used, with a caveat |
| cube not detected, nothing detected, unreadable | **reject** — not used |

A clipped cube is a warning because the cube *was* found, so the frame is a real
viewpoint; only this stage's crop fails, and VGGT's centre crop takes over. Only
a genuine absence is unrecoverable.

| capture | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| `small_leg` | 5 of 6 usable, 1 rejected | **6 of 6 used, 1 warning** — `IMG_4458` no longer needs `--continue-on-rejected`; same learned colour, same downstream numbers |
| `short_leg` | 1 of 8, run refused | **8 of 8**, spurious colour discarded |
| `est_325` | 0 of 8, all unreadable | **8 of 8**, correctly finds no band |

---

## 8. What is still not known

The honest limits, which a proposal should state before someone else does.

- **No independent ground truth for any measured object.** Every accuracy figure
  in this project is the system checking itself or one method against another.
  Water displacement on a held-out object is the missing experiment.
- **`REFERENCE_REAL_SIZE_CM = 14.0` has never been measured.** The cube is
  handmade cardboard; a 2 mm build error is 1.4% linear and **4.3% of volume** on
  every result — larger than most of the improvements above.
- **Which ghost sheet is the true surface** (§4), worth about 4% of limb volume.
- **Stage 6's calibration** is unresolved by design, pending review by that
  stage's author.
- **The marker-colour work is validated on one capture.** That a *learned* colour
  generalises to a red or blue band is argued from the mechanism, not shown.
- **Three silent failure paths remain**, listed as open items 3, 4 and 5 in
  [`../../reviews/repo_review.md`](../../reviews/repo_review.md).

# Session log — 27 August 2026

The first accuracy measurement this project has ever had, the defects it
exposed, and what it settles.

## 1. The reference changed, and that is what unblocked everything

Captures from August 2026 use a **10 cm 3D-printed cube**, not the 14 cm
handmade cardboard one. `REFERENCE_REAL_SIZE_CM` had been 14.0, so every volume
from a 10 cm capture was inflated by `(14/10)³ = 2.74` with no visible sign —
Stage 6 derives scale from the reference's own volume, so the cube reports its
nominal whatever that nominal is.

It now defaults to 10.0 and is overridable per run, because the older fixtures
(`small_leg`, `short_leg`, `est_325`) still need 14:

```python
REFERENCE_REAL_SIZE_CM = float(os.environ.get("REFERENCE_REAL_SIZE_CM", 10.0))
```

The upgrade matters more than the number. This file has listed
*"`REFERENCE_REAL_SIZE_CM` has never been measured"* as the item that **blocks
everything**, because a taped cardboard cube carries a build error nobody can
bound. A printed part does not, which is what makes an accuracy figure quotable
at all.

## 2. Ground truth exists: five water-displacement volumes

| capture | measured | displacement | error |
|---|---|---|---|
| `orange shirt` | 4094 cm³ | 4090 | **+0.1%** |
| `keng` | 2249 cm³ | 2210 | **+1.8%** |
| `black shirt` | 3648 cm³ | 3510 | **+3.9%** |
| `sunshine` | 3093 cm³ | 3130 | **−1.2%** |
| `champ` | 3354 cm³ | 2810 | +19.4% — unresolved, §5 |
| `blue shirt` | — | 3420 | capture unusable, §6 |

**Mean absolute error 1.7% on four captures**, worst case 3.9%. Verified on a
full cold run — Stage 0's detectors, a fresh VGGT pass, every stage after it —
which reproduces the cached-Stage-1 numbers to seven significant figures.

That ±1.7% sits on the ~1–2% surface-noise floor measured independently as local
shell thickness. The two agreeing is corroboration; it also means the pipeline
cannot currently resolve better than its own noise. n = 4, one subject class,
one floor, one cord colour — repeatability, not generality.

## 3. Four defects in marker detection, and what each was worth

The first run of the new captures cut in the wrong place on four of six. Root
cause was not the plane fit.

**The contrast rule had a floor and no ceiling.** Stage 3 projects each point's
chromaticity onto the line from the limb's colour to the band's and keeps
`score > 0.5`. A score of 1.0 *is* the band, so anything well above it is
further from the limb than the band is — which nothing on that limb can be.
Measured on champ with its own learned colours: skin −0.06, floor tile +0.94,
band 1.00, neutral grey +1.14, **the subject's grey shorts +1.54**. The shorts
won the cut. `MARKER_SCORE_MAX = 1.5`.

**A short axis was measured through rather than refused.** The score divides by
`|axis|²`, so when band and limb sit close together every ordinary surface lands
inside the window:

```
small_leg     0.0941   neutral grey scores −0.30   works
black shirt   0.0433                       +1.12   grey selected
champ         0.0323                       +1.14   grey selected
sunshine      0.0308                       +2.62   the whole limb selected
keng          0.0213                       +0.04   marginal
```

`MARKER_MIN_AXIS = 0.05` refuses that case and hands detection back to the
config colour window. **This is the change that fixed the cuts**, and it fires
on all five: the learned-colour path is switched off across the board on these
captures, and the hardcoded window does the detecting. On champ it selects 262
points of 81,859 — 0.3% of the limb — which DBSCAN splits into exactly the two
bands, 194 and 68 points.

> Stated plainly because it is uncomfortable: **the ±1.7% comes from the
> hardcoded khaki window, not from the learned-colour work.** Before the
> refusal existed the learned path was active and was the direct cause of four
> bad cuts. See the note added to `updates.md` §3.

**Candidate planes were capped by point count before being validated.**
`clean.py` trimmed to the two best-supported by `npts`, then gated. That ranking
prefers exactly the wrong thing — a real band is small because only its
camera-facing arc reconstructs. On champ the genuine 964-point band was dropped
in favour of the 5,265-point shorts. Gating now runs first.

**The height floor could not transfer between captures.**
`MARKER_MIN_HEIGHT_FRAC = 0.20` is a fraction of the limb's own span, and the
span is not a property of the subject — it is however much leg was in shot. The
same physical ankle band sits at 44% of the span on `small_leg` and 18% on
these. `MARKER_MIN_HEIGHT_CUBES = 1.0` measures it in reference-cube heights
instead, which is one physical length.

## 4. A new gate: is the plane perpendicular to the limb?

A cord tied round a limb lies across it, so the plane's normal points along the
limb. A plane fitted to a blob of skin or clothing takes the blob's own
orientation. This is the only test that catches such a plane — it can be large,
well clustered and at a plausible height:

```
GENUINE BANDS                    FALSE PLANES
  keng        208 pts   5.8°       champ shorts   5 265 pts  70.5°
  champ knee  964 pts   9.2°       champ floor    2 597 pts  53.2°
  black ankle 299 pts   9.2°       black arch       360 pts  55.1°
  black knee 1 094 pts 27.0°       keng blob      1 501 pts  88.6°
                                   sunshine      43 468 pts  86.8°
```

`MARKER_MAX_AXIS_ANGLE_DEG = 35`, with 8° of margin below and 18° above.

**The first implementation was wrong, and the ground-truth table is what caught
it.** Fitting the limb's axis as the principal direction of a thin slab of
points returns the limb's *width*: a calf is ~10 cm across, and a slab thin
enough to be local is thinner than that, so its greatest-extent direction comes
out horizontal. It passed a synthetic test on a narrow cylinder and then
rejected the genuine bands on `orange_shirt` (53° "off axis") and `black_shirt`
(65°), sending both from +0.1% and +4.4% to +45.9% and +30.9%. A regression that
size is invisible without a scoreboard. The axis now comes from **slice
centroids** — divide a window of the limb into slices, take each centroid, fit a
line through them — which sits on the centre line whatever the cross-section
looks like.

## 5. Which planes cut is now stated, not inferred

`MARKER_CUT_MODE = "upper"`. The displacement volumes were taken
foot-to-upper-band, so the cut has to be foot-to-upper-band or the pipeline is
answering a different question from the ruler. That was previously emergent: a
two-band capture became a "keep between" cut purely because two bands were
found. Both bands are still detected, published and drawn for review; only the
upper one cuts.

## 6. champ, unresolved

Its cut is the best-aligned of the five — 194 points, 42.6 cm above the floor,
**2.4°** off the limb's own axis — and its cube the second most cubic. Yet it
reads +19.4%.

2.81 L matches no segment its markers define. Reconstructing the uncut limb and
measuring every one:

```
below the UPPER band (what ships)   3379 cm³   +20.2%
BETWEEN the two bands               2377 cm³   −15.4%
foot alone, below the lower band    1002 cm³
```

A continuous sweep puts 2810 cm³ at a boundary **35.6 cm** above the floor —
mid-shin, 7 cm below the knee band, where there is no marker. The other four
corroborate their band positions to 1–2 cm.

Three explanations tested and rejected: not the cut (best-aligned of the five),
not the reference (fitted faces read 9.96 / 9.96 / 10.25 cm, the most square in
the set), not surface noise (shell 0.57 mm against 0.42–0.68 mm across the set).
What the numbers do say is that champ's limb reconstructs about **9% wider in
circumference** than 2.81 L over that length implies — 30.3 cm against 27.8 —
and 9% on a diameter is 19% on a volume, which is the whole discrepancy.

A tape measure round the calf at a marked height separates "reconstructs wide"
from "truth is wrong", costs a minute, and is independent of both the water and
the cube.

## 7. blue shirt: the failure no gate catches

Excluded at its owner's instruction —
[`inputs/blue shirt/UNUSABLE.md`](../../../inputs/blue%20shirt/UNUSABLE.md). VGGT's
reconstruction is wrong, so nothing downstream can correct it.

What is worth keeping is that **the run still produced a confident 5280 cm³ with
every gate passing.** Stage 0 rejected the frame with no cube, the corroboration
rule discarded a marker colour found on 4 of 7 frames, the deferred cut declined
to cut. Every one of those checks the *capture* or the *cut*. None checks the
*reconstruction*.

So Stage 6 now runs one that does. The cube is the only object whose true shape
is known and it goes through the identical pipeline as the subject:

```
orange shirt  0.874     sunshine    0.891
keng          0.873     champ       0.876
black shirt   0.873     blue shirt  0.787   <- flagged
```

`REFERENCE_FILL_MIN = 0.83` — mesh volume over its own oriented box. The five
sound captures span 1.8 percentage points; the bad one sits 8.6 below all of
them. Note what does *not* separate them: the cube's edge lengths. blue shirt's
read 9.67 / 10.23 / 10.30 cm, squarely mid-pack. A dented surface keeps its
bounding box and loses volume.

## 8. Stage 6 is settled: keep M1

`stage06_experiments.md` says the deciding experiment cannot be run. It can now.
Every derivation scored against all five truths at once:

| derivation | mean abs error, 4 captures |
|---|---|
| **M1 · calibrate on the cube's volume — ships** | **1.7%** |
| M3b · shortest horizontal OBB edge | 1.4% |
| M10b · fitted faces, all three pairs | 1.8% |
| M3 · mean of two horizontal OBB edges | 7.4% |
| **M10 · fitted faces, horizontals — the recommendation** | **4.1%** |

M10 is more than twice as inaccurate as the method it was written to replace.
The epistemic objection to M1 stands untouched — it forces the reference to
report its own nominal — but the error bar now comes from held-out objects,
which exist, rather than from a calibration that measures worse.

**No calibration can rescue champ.** The cube edge each capture would need to
come out exact: orange 10.00, sunshine 9.96, keng 10.06, black 10.13, **champ
10.61**. Four agree to ±1.3%; champ needs 6.1% more, and its cube is not
anomalous. Every method that improves champ ruins the other four in proportion.

`fit_box_faces` had to be fixed before M10 could be tested at all: its greedy
loop peeled one sliver at a time, rebuilding a 4000×N similarity matrix per
iteration, and did not finish in 90 s on four of five cubes. It now stops once
the unclaimed area cannot reach `min_area_frac`, which cannot skip a face it
would otherwise find. 90 s+ → ~1 s.

## 9. Every open item in `../../reviews/repo_review.md` is closed

Items 3, 4 and 5 — the three latent silent failures — and item 11, the ignored
flag. Each now names its exception and what the fallback costs; `orchestrator.py`
threads `crop=` and `output_size=` through so `run.py --no-prep-crop` works.

## 10. Corrections to this record

**`small_leg` no longer reads 1081.94 cm³.** Two cold runs on the current tree
give **1067.57**, reproducible to seven significant figures with the same 284
marker points. The difference is upstream of Stage 3: the archived
`work/verify_full` accepted 5 of 6 frames where the current Stage 0 accepts 6,
which is the verdict redesign this file records under E-stage0-verdicts. The
archive predates it. With Stage 2 held fixed the marker plane is bit-identical,
so none of the 2026-08-27 changes moved it. **Every 1081.94 in these documents
is a figure from the older tree.**

**The two entry points agree to 7 significant figures, not bit-for-bit.**
`run.py` reads 2249.0995 on `keng` where `stagerun.py` reads 2249.0992, a
relative difference of 1.3 × 10⁻⁷. Two runs of the *same* entry point differ by
2–3 × 10⁻⁷, so the entry points agree as closely as a run agrees with itself.
The standing regression test passes in substance; "bit-identical" is no longer
literally true, and the likely source is thread scheduling inside Open3D's
Poisson solve.

## 11. Still open

- **champ**, above. One tape measure settles which side is wrong.
- **`REFERENCE_REAL_SIZE_CM = 10.0` is a design dimension**, not a caliper
  reading. Printed parts shrink 0.3–0.8%; at 10 cm a 2 mm error is 6.1% of
  volume, which would dominate the 1.7% residual.
- **`dilate` is still specified in pixels.** Deriving it from the cord's own
  measured width is the right fix, but it changes the learned colour on every
  capture including the ones now reading +0.1%, so it wants doing separately
  against the truth table.
- **n = 4.** A fifth and sixth capture would tell you whether 1.7% is the
  pipeline or this subject.
