"""Segment volume from taped circumferences, by the disc model.

Each measured interval is treated as a truncated cone between the two
circumferences bounding it, and the segment is the sum of those slices. See
docs/guides/measuring_ground_truth.md for the procedure the input comes from and for
the bias this model carries.

Input is a CSV of one row per measurement:

    subject,side,height_cm,circumference_cm
    0,left,0.0,20.5
    0,left,4.0,22.8
    ...

`height_cm` is measured up from the lower band, so the lower band is 0.0 and the
upper band is the largest height for that limb.
