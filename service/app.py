"""HTTP front end for the measurement pipeline.

The browser cannot do this work: stage 1 is VGGT-1B and stage 0 loads
GroundingDINO and SAM, so "end to end in the web app" means the page drives a
GPU on the local network. This service is that link, and nothing more — it
validates an upload, runs `stagerun.py`, and serves what the stages wrote.

Run it from the repo root, which is where `work/` lives:

    uvicorn service.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

The flow it exposes mirrors the pipeline's own shape rather than flattening it.
Stage 0 is a gate: it decides whether a set of photos can be measured at all,
and a frame that clips the reference cube corrupts the scale for every number
downstream while looking perfectly normal. So an upload runs stage 0 alone and
stops, the user is shown what was rejected and why, and only then do stages
1-6 run.

The cut is treated the same way. Stages 1-6 run with `--no-cut`, so the limb is
reconstructed and measured whole while the marker planes are only detected and
published. The user approves or moves them, and stages 3-6 re-run to apply the
cut they chose. Cutting on the first pass instead would put a volume on screen
that was derived from a cut nobody had agreed to, and then ask them to confirm
it -- the confirmation would be theatre.
