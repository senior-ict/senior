"""Ghost reduction — voxel dedup, normal-aware rejection, and MLS projection.

VGGT emits duplicated, slightly offset copies of a surface across views ("ghost"
sheets, typically ~2 mm apart). Removing them takes all three functions here, and
they do genuinely different jobs — the chain was mis-attributed twice before it
was measured, so it is worth stating plainly:

  - `ghost_voxel_downsample` replaces the points in each occupied voxel with
    their centroid. It does **not** remove the ghost: two sheets about 2.7 mm
    apart usually land in different voxels and both survive. What it does is set
    the point spacing, and since MLS's radius is measured in multiples of
    spacing, this is what makes MLS's neighbourhood physically wide enough to
    span the gap. It is the dominant decimation step — see GHOST_VOXEL_FACTOR —
    and removing it costs +2.59% on the reported volume.

  - `normal_aware_filter` drops points whose orientation disagrees with their
    neighbourhood. A surviving ghost fragment is sparse, so its normals scatter.
    This removes ~3% of points and is not load-bearing on the volume.

  - `mls_project` is what actually collapses the sheets. Rather than deciding
    which one to delete, it fits a local surface through each neighbourhood and
    projects every point onto it, so both sheets land on one and the shell goes
    from ~1.76 mm thick to ~0.79 mm.

def ghost_voxel_downsample(points, colors, voxel_size):
    """Replace the points in each occupied voxel with their centroid.

    This is `open3d.geometry.PointCloud.voxel_down_sample`. It replaced a
    hand-rolled 30-line grid (`voxel_dedup`) on 2026-08-23, after an A/B on
    `inputs/small_leg` put the two **0.15% apart** on the reported limb volume —
    1083.54 cm³ against 1081.94. The only mechanical difference is where the grid
    is anchored: the old code used `points.min(axis=0)`, Open3D uses its own
    origin, so a few points near a cell boundary land on the other side and the
    centroids shift slightly. See docs/experiments/ghost_removal_chain.md.

    The name says downsample, not dedup, because that is what it does. It does
    **not** remove the ghost: the two sheets are about 2.7 mm apart and usually
    fall in different voxels, so both survive. Its job is to set the point
    spacing, which is what gives `mls_project` a neighbourhood wide enough to
    span the gap — `MLS_RADIUS_MULT` is measured in spacings, not millimetres.

    Three things this wrapper exists to guarantee, all of which a bare library
    call would lose:

      - `voxel_size <= 0` returns the cloud untouched. `GHOST_VOXEL_FACTOR = 0`
        is the documented way to disable this step, and the experiment measuring
        what the step is worth (+2.59% on the limb) depends on it.
      - colours survive as uint8. Open3D wants floats in 0-1 and hands them back
        the same way, and it averages colours only if the cloud actually carries
        them.
      - an empty cloud is returned as-is rather than raising.
