# Stage 3 floor removal band, in multiples of the RANSAC distance threshold.
#
# VGGT reconstructs the floor as a duplicate pair of sheets — the same ghosting
# it produces on the limb — so the floor is about two thresholds thick. Removing
# only the RANSAC inliers takes the middle and leaves BOTH skins behind:
#
#   distance from fitted plane, points surviving a 1x removal
#     [-0.010,-0.005)  20,080

#     [+0.005,+0.010)  21,669
#
# Those 41,749 leftover points are a full-size slab of floor. DBSCAN then links
# the limb, the cube and that slab into one cluster, so Stage 3 exported the
# whole scene as the limb and labelled a 3,743-point sliver as the object.
#
# At 2x the floor stops reappearing (the next dominant plane is a wall, dot 0.19
# with the floor instead of 1.00) and the box cluster becomes cube-shaped
# (cubeness 0.87, extent 0.317/0.329/0.365). Past 2x the gain flattens — 3x
# removes only 7k more, 4x only 3k — while eating into whatever rests on
# the floor.

# Stage 3 marker detection
#
# The old rule was `saturation > 15 AND hue > 60`, which accepts hue 60-360 —

# On inputs/small_leg that classified two things as markers:
#
#   shadow  RGB(8,6,8)      V=3.1%    hue is arbitrary at that brightness
#   skin    RGB(139,87,89)  hue=358degrees, which `hue > 60` happily admits
#
# The shadow cluster had 3349 supporting points against 197 for the real band,
# so it won the cut and the pipeline measured a slab of ankle.
#
# These bounds describe a genuinely green marker. MARKER_VAL_MIN is the
# important one: hue is numerically unstable as value approaches zero, so any

# 2G-R-B. This is the rule that actually finds the band, not the hue window.
# The small_leg marker is khaki, RGB(60,52,30) — hue 44 degrees, so it fails

# Raising this to 15 silently lost the only real marker in the dataset.

# Reject marker planes found low on the object. Feet, shadows under the arch
# and the floor junction all live there, and a cut line placed that low would

#
# The floor is expressed in REFERENCE CUBE HEIGHTS above the ground, not as a
# fraction of the limb's own span, because the span is not a property of the
# subject -- it is however much leg happened to be in shot. On inputs/small_leg
# the cluster is a calf and a foot; on the Aug 2026 captures it runs from the
# floor to mid-thigh, so the same physical ankle band sits at 44% of the span
# in one and 18% in the other. A fraction rule cannot hold both. The cube is a
# known 10 cm standing on the same floor, so one cube height is one physical
# length that transfers between captures.
#
# Measured on the Aug 2026 captures: the cube is 15-17% of the limb span, and
# the genuine ankle bands sit at 18.2% (champ) and 18.3% (black shirt) -- above
# one cube height, below the old 20% fraction, and rejected by it. The false
# planes it exists to catch are the floor junction at 6.8% and the arch at 7%,

#
# What "auto" reads is deliberately not one detector's opinion. Stage 0 counts
# the bands in the photographs, across frames, and Stage 3 fits planes to the
# marker points in 3D; auto cuts a span only when BOTH say two. Either alone is
# a known failure: Stage 3 has fitted a plausible second plane to clothing and
# to a floor junction, and Stage 0's detector will return a second box for a
# cord's own shadow. Requiring agreement means a single false positive can no
# longer change what quantity is being reported.
#
# It still is not a measurement. What a run reports has to match what the ruler
# measured, and the Aug 2026 displacement volumes were taken foot-to-upper-band
# -- so a two-band capture measured against those must be run with an explicit
# --cut-mode upper, and re-measuring the ground truth is the alternative. Auto

#
# 1.5 keeps a full half-width of slack above the band for shading and view
# angle while excluding the shorts. On inputs/small_leg nothing between 0.5
# and 1.5 changes, because its axis is long enough that neutral surfaces score
# -0.30 and never approached the window.

# Bottom-cap grid spacing, as a multiple of scan point spacing.

# sampling — it only needs to be dense enough that the alpha shape cannot punch
# through it. The smallest alpha multiplier is 8x spacing (see
# workers/recons_methods_worker.py), so 3x leaves a wide margin.
#
# At 1.0 the cap was 100,559 points on small_leg — 77% of the whole cut cloud
# was fabricated floor, and it fed Stage 4 a dense coplanar slab, which is the
# degenerate input for Delaunay tetrahedralization. This constant was implicitly
# 1.0 before Stage 3 stopped downsampling, when scan spacing was ~4x coarser.
CAP_SPACING_MULT = 3.0

# Bounds on the resulting cap point count, applied after the multiplier.
#
# The multiplier alone is not safe at both ends. The reference cube's bottom
# cross-section is tiny (its underside is against the floor and barely
# reconstructs), so 3x took its cap from 150 points to 16 — too few to close
# anything, and the alpha search had to run out to 70x before the box sealed.
# The limb's foot has ~200x that area and needed the coarsening.
#
# So: pick spacing from the multiplier, then adjust it until the count lands in
# this window. Area per point is spacing squared, so spacing = sqrt(area / n).

# Stage 3 MLS surface projection
#
# Collapses VGGT's duplicate ghost sheet onto a single surface by projecting
# each point onto a locally fitted quadratic. This is the only thing that has
# worked on the ghosting — filtering cannot, because the ghost is parallel to
# the true surface (invisible to the normal filter) and repeated consistently
# across views (invisible to multi-view consistency).
#
# Radius is in multiples of point spacing and MUST exceed the ghost separation,
# or both sheets never share a neighbourhood: at 2.0 nothing moved at all.
#
# It moves points rather than removing them, so it costs some volume — measured
# on small_leg (shell std / convex hull):
#     off    0.93 mm   1922 cm3
#     3.0x   0.60 mm   1887 cm3   -1.8%
#     4.0x   0.41 mm   1833 cm3   -4.6%
#     6.0x   0.29 mm   1788 cm3   -7.0%
# Whether that shrinkage is noise removal or real surface is unresolved: it
# depends on whether the true surface is the inner or outer sheet, which we
# cannot currently determine. 0 disables.
MLS_RADIUS_MULT = 4.0

# A second, wider MLS pass on the limb only, run after the pass above.
#
# The 4x pass above denoises each ghost sheet but cannot merge them: on
# inputs/test6 the two sheets sit ~1 cm apart and 4x spacing is ~1 cm, so each
# sheet only ever sees itself. Poisson then finds two nearby surfaces, bridges
# them, and produces a tunnelled solid (chi from -2 to -22 on 5 of 8 runs),
# which forces the alpha-shape fallback -- and the alpha wrap loose enough to
# close encloses 13-17% more area than the points on every slice above the
# calf (measured, docs/experiments/test_captures/ring_gallery.png).
#
# A wider pass merges the sheets. Swept offline on 2026-09-18 from the pre-MLS
# cluster, with the can as the control (its girth is +0.9% against calipers):
#
#     second pass    test6 girth   poisson   test6 span      can girth   can vol
#     none (today)     +10.0%       chi=-6     +38.7% (alpha)   +0.5%     alpha
#     16x sphere        +9.6%       chi= 2     +15.4%           +0.6%     384.4
#     24x sphere       +10.0%       chi= 2     +16.7%           +0.6%     386.4
#
# 16x closes Poisson on both objects, so the fallback never fires, and the
# solid's cross-section sits on the points (mesh/ellipse area 0.99 against
# 1.105 today). It does NOT change the girth -- the merged ring lands between
# the two sheets, where the ellipse fit already was -- so the residual error it
# leaves is real and visible rather than hidden under the wrap. Ellipsoidal
# neighbourhoods were tried and rejected: same girth, same shape, but they
# leave a strand of the second sheet and Poisson tunnels again.
#
# Applied after the first pass, not instead of it: a single 24x pass distorted
# both objects (test6 girth swung to -12.7%), while 4x-then-24x held. Stacking
# denoises each sheet before the wide pass has to span them.
#

# cloud it is a larger physical distance. Validated on two objects only. 0

# its faces are planar, and that is known about the object rather than inferred
# from the cloud. On a flat face the quadratic's a^2, ab and b^2 terms can only
# fit noise and the ghost sheet itself, so it can curve to follow the very
# structure MLS is meant to collapse. A plane cannot, so it flattens both sheets
# harder -- and Stage 6 measures the cube by fitting planes to those faces, so
# flatter faces feed straight into the scale.
#
# The cost is at the edges: a neighbourhood spanning two faces gets a plane
# sitting diagonally across both, which pulls the corner inward. Rim rounding is
# already 0.11-0.13 cm and this can only add to it. Whether the trade is
# favourable depends on whether flat interiors outweigh sharper rims.

# Lower keeps more surface detail but retains more VGGT ghost artifacts.
# Points below are the combined total across the box and limb clusters, since

# the real spacing gives the same voxel the validated runs had (0.0046 on

# coarser one. Equivalent to the old 0.65 on a ~350k-point cloud.
