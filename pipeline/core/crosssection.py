"""Cross-section circumference at the cutting plane, by least-squares ellipse fit.

Stage 6 reports a volume, which says nothing about the shape that produced it.
A circumference at the cut is the one limb dimension that can be checked against
a tape measure without water, so it is measured here and printed alongside.

The slice is taken from `leg.ply`, Stage 3's complete limb, never a cut one:
the cut caps the
exposed cross-section with a synthetic grid (`core/fill.py:cap_points_on_plane`)
that lies on exactly the plane being measured, and fitting to those interior
points pulls the ellipse inward. `leg.ply` is the same cloud levelled and
floor-cut but before the cut and before any capping, so every point in the slab
is reconstructed surface.

Both cloud and plane must be in LEVELLED space, which is why the plane is read
from `cutting_line_review.json` or `cutting_line_levelled.json` and never
`cutting_line.json` — the planes are detected before levelling and the clouds
written after. The review copy wins when it exists: it holds the planes the
measured mesh was actually cut at, which is what a circumference has to describe.
