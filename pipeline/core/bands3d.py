"""Marker planes from Stage 0's band boxes, through Stage 1's own pointmap.

Stage 3 finds the cut by colour: it selects the band's points out of the dense
cloud and fits a plane to them. That works when the cord is chromatically far
enough from the limb to be separable, and fails silently when it is not -- and
"not" is common. On the job that prompted this module the learned band/limb
separation was 0.0259 against a floor of MARKER_MIN_AXIS = 0.05, so the learned
colour was refused, the config's khaki window matched 130 points on the entire
limb, and the lower of the subject's two cords survived as an 11-point cluster
that MARKER_MIN_CLUSTER_PTS then dropped. Stage 0 had detected that same cord on
6 of 7 photographs.

So the information exists; it is just in the wrong space. Stage 0 records each
band's box in frame pixels, and Stage 1's `world_points` is a 3D position for
every pixel of every frame it was given. Mapping one through the other turns a
2D detection into thousands of 3D points, without asking any colour question at
all -- which is the point, since colour is what failed.

What this does NOT do is replace colour detection. It is a second, independent
source, merged with the first in Stage 3, so a capture can only ever gain a
plane here. The band boxes come from a detector prompted with "a rubber band on
the leg", so a plane fitted here means the photographs showed a band there.

The pixel mapping has two cases, and getting them backwards puts the plane
somewhere else entirely:

  cropped frames    Stage 0 wrote `image[top:bottom, left:right]` resized to
                    518x518, so the map is linear from that window.
  uncropped frames  Stage 0 wrote the frame whole and VGGT cropped it itself:
                    width is resized to 518, the height to the nearest multiple
                    of 14, and the centre 518 rows are kept.
