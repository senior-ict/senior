"""Stage 0 — frame the subject before VGGT ever sees it.

VGGT is handed a 518x518 square. On 9:16 phone photos its default centre crop
resizes the width to 518 and cuts the height to match, which discards 43.8% of
every frame — measured on inputs/small_leg, original rows 840..3000 of 3840
survive. That is not a neutral loss: it clipped the reference cube's base in two
of six frames and put the limb's marker band outside the frame in several, which
is why Stage 3 found only one marker plane instead of two.

The obvious fix, keeping the whole frame by padding, was tested and is not
better in the way that matters. At 518 it improved the global fit — floor
planarity 3.14 -> 2.69 mm RMS, and the two horizontal reference edges agreed
three times more closely, 1.10% -> 0.37% — but the subject shrank from 518 to
291 px across and the limb lost 11% of its volume. At 1022 it failed outright:
the full frame re-admitted the chair and the seated body, and Stage 3 selected
the chair as the reference cube.

So the centre crop was doing two jobs, and only one of them was wasteful. It
threw away pixels, but it also isolated the subject. This stage keeps the second
job and drops the first: find the cube and the limb, and cut a square that
contains both with margin, so the subject fills the frame VGGT is given.

The cube is located by its own ArUco markers rather than by a detector — exact,
free, and it doubles as a scale, since the cube is a known size and its apparent
size tracks distance. The limb needs a model; a person box is too coarse,
because it contains the torso and head and its union with the cube demands a
square larger than the frame, so a segmentation mask is clipped to a band
reaching up from the floor that the cube itself defines.

One caveat this stage cannot fix, and it is the reason CENTRE_ON_SUBJECT
defaults to False. VGGT's pose encoding carries no principal point: it emits
cx = cy = image centre on every frame. An off-centre crop presents it with a
camera it cannot represent, and on inputs/small_leg the subject sits 8.5 degrees
off axis on average and 14.8 at worst. Recentring therefore trades a known pixel
loss for an unknown geometric bias. The window is kept concentric with the frame
by default, and merely tightened around the subject.

    Plural, because the count is a fact about the capture and not a detail of
    the detector. Taking the detector's best box alone cannot tell a limb
    wearing one band from a limb wearing two, so a two-band subject was framed
    around whichever band scored higher: the crop window was sized to hold that
    one, and the other could fall outside it with nothing said. What the count
    then means is decided downstream -- one band bounds the limb from above,
    two bound a segment between them.

    Boxes come back best-score first with duplicates already suppressed by IoU
    (`core/vlm_detect.py:detect_all`), and each must pass three guards, of which
    the first two were measured on captures that got them wrong:

    1. The box must overlap the limb, so a band-like object elsewhere in the

    2. **The box must be small relative to the limb.** An open-vocabulary
       detector always returns its best candidate for "cord", and on a capture
       with no cord at all its best candidate is the leg itself -- which passes
       guard 1 trivially, because the leg is entirely on the leg.
    3. It must sit clear of the bands already accepted. IoU suppression removes
       boxes that overlap; two boxes on one cord need not overlap -- the cord
       and the shadow under it are a real pair -- and counting those as two
       bands would put every one-band capture into a two-band cut.

    Guard 2 is measured, not guessed. Band area as a fraction of the limb's mask
    area, over three datasets:

        inputs/small_leg (a real band)   0.04 - 0.07
        inputs/est_325   (no band)       1.23
        inputs/short_leg (no band)       2.19 - 2.91

    A cord tied around a limb cannot be larger than the limb. BAND_MAX_LIMB_FRAC
    sits at 0.35 -- five times the largest real band seen, and a third of the
    smallest false one.

    What this cost before it was fixed: on inputs/short_leg the hallucinated band
    inflated the crop window until nothing fit, and Stage 0 rejected 5 of 8
    frames as `objects out of window`. With the guard, all 8 pass. It also fed
    `trace_band_colour` a box that is mostly skin, so the "band" colour handed to
    Stage 3 was the limb's own colour -- leaving the discriminant with no
    contrast to separate them by.

    Returns a list of boxes, topmost in the frame first, at most MAX_BANDS long.
